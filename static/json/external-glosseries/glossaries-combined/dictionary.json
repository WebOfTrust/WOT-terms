The term takes its name from an allegory, the &quot;Byzantine Generals Problem&quot;, developed to describe a situation in which, in order to avoid catastrophic failure of the system, the system&#39;s actors must agree on a concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable.In a Byzantine fault, a component such as a server can inconsistently appear both failed and functioning to failure-detection systems, presenting different symptoms to different observers. It is difficult for the other components to declare it failed and shut it out of the network, because they need to first reach a consensus regarding which component has failed in the first place.Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is the dependability of a fault-tolerant computer system to such conditions.</p><h4>Consensus two third</h4><p>A system has Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) when it can keep functioning correctly as long as two-thirds of the network agree or reaches consensus. BFT is a property or characteristic of a system that can resist up to one-third of the nodes failing or acting maliciously.</p><p>The pBFT model primarily focuses on providing a practical Byzantine state machine replication that tolerates Byzantine faults (malicious nodes) through an assumption that there are independent node failures and manipulated messages propagated by specific, independent nodes.The algorithm is designed to work in asynchronous systems and is optimized to be high-performance with an impressive overhead runtime and only a slight increase in latency.

For an <a href=\"autonomic-identifier\">autonomic identifier (AID)</a>, a controlling entity has the capability to make changes to the <a href=\"key-event-log\">key event log (KEL)</a> of the AID. This capability is typically asserted by the control of a set of cryptographic keys used by software acting on behalf of the controller, though it might also be asserted via other mechanisms.</p><p>At any point in time, an identifier has at least one but may have more than one controlling entity. This set of controlling entities constitutes the controller. Without loss of generality, when the context is unambiguous, the term controller may refer either to the whole set or a member of the set of controlling entities.</p><p>All <a href=\"key-event\">key events</a> on the identifier must include a signature from the sole controlling entity when there is only one controlling entity or at least one signature from one of the controlling entities when there is more than one. Typically, when there is more than one controlling entity, control is established via signatures from all or a subset of controlling entities. This is called <a href=\"multisig\">multi-signature (multi-sig)</a>. In a threshold multi-sig scheme, the control authority is split among the controlling entities, where each is assigned a weight. In this case, the control authority over the identifier is established via signatures from a subset of controlling entities whose combined weights exceed an agreed threshold. These thresholded multiple signatures may be expressed as a single collective threshold signature when a collective signing scheme is used.</p><p>The control authority over an identifier can also be divided into signing authority and rotation authority. The controller of the identifier may grant their authority to other entities. For example, in <a href=\"custodial-rotation\">custodial rotation</a>, the controller grants a designated custodial agent the signing authority while retaining their rotation authority. In the case of a <a href=\"delegated-identifier\">delegated identifier</a>, the delegated identifier is granted some degree of control authority from its delegating identifier.</p>",

The direct mode doesn&#39;t use witnesses nor <a href=\"key-event-receipt-log\">KERL</a>s, but has direct (albeit intermittent) network contact with the validator.</p><h4>Operational mode</h4><p>To protect a <a href=\"validator\">validator</a> when engaging with some other controller’s identifier, be it <a href=\"verification\">verification</a>, control authority establishment, or <a href=\"duplicity\">duplicity</a> detection, are based on an ability to <em>replay</em> the sequence of key events (key event history or log) of that identifier. There are two main operational modes for providing replay capability that are distinguished by the degree of availability of the identifier’s controller when creating and promulgating the key events.<br>With direct mode, the promulgation of events to a validator does not happen unless the controller is attached to the network and able to communicate directly with a validator.<br>Direct mode assumes that the controller may have intermittent network availability, it also assumes that these mechanism may not be trusted in any persistent sense to promulgate key events. Nonetheless, direct mode is important as it is compatible with the use of mobile internet devices such as cell phones. A single direct mode identifier may be re-used in multiple one-to-one relationships as part of a select group.<br>More in <a href=\"https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf\">Source: chapter Protocol Operational Modes in KERI white paper</a></p><h4>Security concerns</h4><p>The protocol may operate in two basic modes, called direct and indirect.

Because the child key is generated from a known seed there is a relationship between the child and parent keys that is invisible to anyone without that seed. The HD protocol (BIP 32) can generate a near infinite number of child keys from a deterministically-generated seed (chain code) from its parent, providing the functionality of being able to recreate those exact same child keys as long as you have the seed.<br>More at <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2016/04/blockchain-workshop/interest/robles.html\">W3 source</a></p>",

Indirect mode supports high (nearly continuous) availability of the key event history to any validator. This means that other components must be trusted to promulgate key events when the controller is not attached to the network. Indirect mode is compatible with identifiers for one-to-many exchanges or any-wise relationships (a controller with any others). A single indirect mode identifier may be used for a public service or business or otherwise when building brand and reputation in that identifier is important.

The delegator creates a cryptographic commitment in either a rotation or interaction event via a seal in a delegated establishment event. The delegate creates a cryptographic commitment in its establishment event via a seal to the delegating event. Each commitment is signed respectively by the committer. This cooperative delegation together with special superseding recovery rules for events enables cooperative recovery.</p><h5>Recursive application</h5><p>This superseding rule may be recursively applied to multiple levels of delegation, thereby enabling recovery of any set of keys signing or pre-rotated in any lower levels by a superseding rotation delegation at the next higher level. This cascades the security of the key management infrastructure of higher levels to lower levels. This is a distinctive security feature of the cooperative delegation of identifiers in KERI.</p><h5>More information</h5><p>More in chapter Nested Delegation Recovery of the <a href=\"https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf\">whitepaper</a></p>",

Anytime it gets a version count code it changes the version and also elevates to the top level (the version count code must appear at the top level). The version count code determines which CESR table to load when parsing the stream. The <a href=\"sniffer\">sniffer</a> detects if CESR binary, CESR Text, JSON, CBOR, MGPK. If any of the last three then the parser regexes to find the version string inside the JSON, CBOR, and MGPK and from the version string extracts the number of characters/bytes that is the length of the JSON, CBOR, or MGPK. The parser then resumes sniffing. When the sniff is CESR then when at the top level looks for the CESR version count code or any other count codes. The interpretation of the count codes is dependent on the version count code that is why the Parser has to start with a default version count code because the stream may not begin with a version code or may have resumed after a cold restart. When a count code is parsed then the parser may descend into parsing whats inside group for a group count code which may recursively nest down a ways.<br>Source Slack Cesride thread: Feb 2 2023</p>",

This provides what we call zero-trust percolated discovery or speedy percolated discovery. Percolation means that each discoverer in turn may share what it discovers with any subsequent discoverers. Since the information so discovered is end-verifiable, the percolation mechanism and percolating intermediaries do not need to be trusted.</p><h5>Percolation Theory</h5><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory\">Percolation theory</a> is a mathematical framework used to study the behavior of connected clusters in random systems. It was originally developed to understand the flow of fluids through porous media, but it has since found applications in various fields, including physics, mathematics, computer science, and social sciences.</p><h5>Invasion Percolation Theory</h5><p>Invasion percolation is a specific variant of percolation theory that models the infiltration of a fluid into a porous medium. It is used to study how a fluid, such as a gas or liquid, spreads through a random network of interconnected sites or pores.</p><p>The invasion process follows the principle of least resistance, where the fluid seeks the path of least resistance through the porous medium. As the invasion progresses, the fluid selectively infiltrates the sites with lower resistance, forming a connected cluster of invaded sites. The invaded cluster grows by adding new invaded sites through the neighboring dry sites with the lowest resistance.</p>",

The elements of a pipeline are often executed in parallel or in time-sliced fashion.

We call this a logical atomic data chunk.</p><h5>JSON is slow</h5><p>With JSON I don’t know where the end is, so I have to parse the initial stream to find out. That&#39;s slow.</p><h5>Meaning of Pipelining</h5><p>That once you have a block of data, that you can pull off chunks and de-multiplex from the stream into cores and multiplex them back into the streams. Cores in big datacenters are now max 5 GHz, a pipeline is 40 GHz. So you have to be able to do pipelining (split off over many cores). <a href=\"CESR\">CESR</a> is the only streaming protocol that has this anticipation on board.<br>Source: Samuel Smith, KERI Zoom meeting Dec 5 2023.</p><h5>Related</h5><p><a href=\"multiplexing\">Multiplexing</a></p>",

The term was originally mostly used in relation to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_of_art\">works of art</a> but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology\">archaeology</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology\">paleontology</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive\">archives</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript\">manuscripts</a>, printed books, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy\">circular economy</a>, and science and computing.</p><h4>Purpose</h4><p>The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, custody and places of storage. The practice has a particular value in helping <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication\">authenticate</a> objects. Comparative techniques, expert opinions and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document\">documentation</a>.

It is the cancelling of an act, the recalling of a grant or privilege, or the making <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(law)\">void</a> of some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deed\">deed</a> previously existing.<br>More on source <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revocation\">Wikipedia</a></p><h4>In identity</h4><p>The term revocation has two completely different meanings in the identity space. In key management one may speak of revoking keys. With statement issuance, authorization issuance, or credential issuance, one may speak of revoking an authorization statement, a token, or a credential.<br>This becomes confusing when the act of revoking keys also implicitly revokes the <a href=\"authorization\">authorization</a> of statements signed with those keys. Any statement may be effectively authorized by virtue of the attached signature(s) made with a set of <a href=\"authoritative\">authoritative</a> keys. The statement itself may be authorizing some other function in the system. So, the verification of the signature on an authorizing statement is essential to determining the authoritativeness of the associated authorized function. To clarify when an authorization is conveyed via a signed statement, the signature acts to authorize the statement.</p><h4>How KERI avoids confusion</h4><p>KERI terminology usually avoids confusion between <a href=\"rotation\">rotation</a> and revocation because a key rotation operation is the equivalent of a key revocation operation <strong>followed by a key replacement operation</strong>. So one operation, rotate, is implemented instead of two operations (revoke and replace).<br><strong>A bare key revocation is indicated by replacement with a null key.</strong> So only one operation is needed, that is, rotate where a special case of rotation is to rotate to a null key.</p><h4>Also see</h4><p><a href=\"revocation-event\">Revocation event</a></p>",

Thus a stream of concatenated primitives may be individually parsed without the need to encapsulate the primitives inside textual delimiters or envelopes. Thus a textual self-framing encoding provides the core capability for a streaming text protocol like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_Text_Oriented_Messaging_Protocol\">STOMP</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/RaetProtocol/raet\">RAET</a>.</p><h4>Related to CESR</h4><p>Although a first class textual encoding of cryptographic primitives is the primary motivation for the <a href=\"composable-event-streaming-representation\">CESR</a> protocol defined herein, CESR is sufficiently flexible and extensible to support other useful data types, such as, integers of various sizes, floating point numbers, date-times as well as generic text.

The threshold <code>M</code> indicates the minimum number of confirming witnesses the controller deems sufficient given some number <code>F</code> of potentially faulty witnesses, given that <code>M &gt;= N - F</code>. This enables a controller to provide itself with any degree of protection it deems necessary given this accountability.</p><p>Note that what may be sufficient for a controller may not be sufficient for a validator. To clarify, let <code>MC</code> denote the threshold size of a sufficient agreement from the perspective of a controller and let <code>MV</code> denote the threshold size of a sufficient agreement from the perspective of a validator. Typically, <code>MV &gt;= MC</code>. </p><h4>TOAD in KEL</h4><p>A controller declares TOAD in its <a href=\"key-event-log\">key event log (KEL)</a> during the <a href=\"inception-event\">key inception event</a> and may edit it during subsequent <a href=\"rotation-event\">key rotation events</a>.</p><h4>Purpose of TOAD</h4><p>A highly available system needs some degree of fault tolerance. The purpose of the threshold of accountability is to enable fault tolerance of the key event service with respect to faulty behavior by either the controller or witnesses. The principal controller fault exhibits duplicitous behavior in the use of its keys. In this case, the threshold serves as the threshold of accountable duplicity. The threshold lets a validator know when it may hold the controller accountable for duplicitous behavior. Without a threshold, a validator may choose to hold a controller accountable upon any evidence of duplicity which may make the service fragile in the presence of any degree of such faulty behavior. The primary way that a validator may hold a controller accountable is to stop trusting any use of the associated identifier. This destroys any value in the identifier and does not allow the controller to recover from an exploit. Recall that the one purpose of rotation keys (pre-rotated unexposed) is to enable recovery from compromised interaction signing keys. A compromised interaction signing key may exhibit duplicitous behavior on the part of the controller. A threshold of accountable duplicity enables a validator to distinguish between potentially recoverable duplicity such as the use of a compromised signing key and non-recoverable duplicity such as the use of a compromised rotation key. This better protects both the validator and the controller and improves the robustness of the service. </p>",

The neat thing is, you could then <strong>transfer the identifier off the ledger</strong> and then have non-ledger based portable identifiers.</p><h4>One at a time</h4><p>Although it&#39;s portable, you can be anchored to any one ledger at a time, or you could move it to an identifier (witness, backer, watcher, etc) can only be represented different ledger, or you could move to using just witnesses, all with the same identifier by justdoing rotation events and changing your anchor, your backers here.<br>So an identifier cannot be anchored, let&#39;s say to multiple Indies or Ethereum. You could be only anchored in one at a time.</p><h4>Move identifiers across networks</h4><p>You can move identifiers across networks with KERI, but it&#39;s not what it has been designed for.</p>",

The entity may be a person, process, object or any combination of such components. The entity can be of any size from a single hardware component or software module, to a piece of equipment identified by make and model, to a site or location, to an organization, to a nation-state. Trust, while inherently a subjective determination, can be based on objective evidence and subjective elements. The objective grounds for trust can include for example, the results of information technology product testing and evaluation. Subjective belief, level of comfort, and experience may supplement (or even replace) objective evidence, or substitute for such evidence when it is unavailable. Trust is usually relative to a specific circumstance or situation (e.g., the amount of money involved in a transaction, the sensitivity or criticality of information, or whether safety is an issue with human lives at stake). Trust is generally not transitive (e.g., you trust a friend but not necessarily a friend of a friend). Finally, trust is generally earned, based on experience or measurement.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span>Source: </span><span class=\"c1 c7\"><a class=\"c2\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-39.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1708545337222320&amp;usg=AOvVaw3kokYXwvWROx-Bj21f_KAW\">NIST Special Publication 800-39</a></span><span class=\"c3 c7\">&nbsp;p.24</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span class=\"c7\">See also: </span><span class=\"c1 c7\"><a class=\"c2\" href=\"#h.syc9o7x61rkm\">transitive trust decision</a></span><span class=\"c3 c7\">.</span></p><p class=\"c0\"><span>For more information, see: </span><span class=\"c1\"><a class=\"c2\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://trustoverip.org/our-work/design-principles/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1708545337222738&amp;usg=AOvVaw3mg25qyuIRHa8r6xMxJZsY\">Design Principles for the ToIP Stack</a></span><span>.</span></p>",

A trust basis binds controllers, identifiers, and key-pairs. <em>For example the Facebook ecosystem of social interactions is a trust domain that relies on Facebook’s identity system of usernames and passwords as its trust basis.</em><br>(<a href=\"https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf\">Source whitepaper</a>)</p><h4>Broader definition</h4><p>A trust domain is a domain that the system trusts to authenticate users. In other words, if a user or application is authenticated by a trusted domain, this authentication is accepted by all domains that trust the authenticating domain.</p><h4>Domain name</h4><p>A more technical meaning of &#39;domain&#39; is on the internet: <a href=\"domain-name\">domain name</a>. </p>",

Validators verify the log, they apply duplicity detection or they leverage somebody else&#39;s duplicity detection or apply any other logic so they can say &quot;Yes, these are events I can trust&quot;.</p><h4>Example</h4><p>During validation of virtual credentials for example, a <a href=\"verifier\">verifier</a> checks to see if a verifiable <a href=\"credential\">credential</a> (<a href=\"VC\">VC</a>) has been signed by the controller of this VC using the applicable verification method.</p><h4>To be Sam-Smith precise in KERI</h4><p>Any entity or agent that evaluates whether or not a given signed statement as attributed to an identifier is valid at the time of its issuance. A valid statement MUST be verifiable, that is, has a verifiable signature from the current controlling keypair(s) at the time of its issuance. Therefore a Validator must first act as a Verifier in order to establish the root authoritative set of keys. Once verified, the Validator may apply other criteria or constraints to the statement in order to determine its validity for a given use case. When that statement is part of a verifiable data structure then the cryptographic verification includes verifying digests and any other structural commitments or constraints. To elaborate, with respect to an AID, for example, a Validator first evaluates one or more KELs in order to determine if it can rely on (trust) the key state (control authority) provided by any given KEL. A necessary but insufficient condition for a valid KEL is it is verifiable i.e. is internally inconsistent with respect to compliance with the KERI protocol. An invalid KEL from the perspective of a Validator may be either unverifiable or may be verifiable but duplicitous with respect to some other verifiable version of that KEL. Detected duplicity by a given validator means that the validator has seen more than one verifiable version of a KEL for a given AID. Reconciliable duplicity means that one and only one version of a KEL as seen by a Validator is accepted as the authoritative version for that validator. Irreconcilable duplicity means that none of the versions of a KEL as seen by a validator are accepted as the authoritative one for that validator. The conditions for reconcilable duplicity are described later.<br>Source <a href=\"https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri/blob/main/draft-ssmith-keri.md#basic-terminology\">Sam Smith</a></p>",

As more organizations do more computing outside their perimeter in the cloud, security teams find it increasingly difficult to trust or identify who and what should be allowed or trusted with access to their networks. As a result, an increasing number of organizations are adopting Zero Trust as an element or a component of their trust network architecture and enterprise security strategy.</p><p>Zero Trust is a security concept that requires all users, even those inside the organization’s enterprise network, to be authenticated, authorized, and continuously validating security configuration and posture, before being granted or keeping access to applications and data. This approach leverages advanced technologies such as multi-factor authentication, identity and access management (IAM), and next-generation endpoint security technology to verify the user’s identity and maintain system security.</p>",

These principles are described at more length elsewhere but may be summarized as follows:</p><ol><li>Network Hostility. The network is always hostile, internally &amp; externally; Locality is not trustworthy. Solutions must provide means to mitigate network layer security vulnerabilities (man-in-the-middle, DNS hijacking, BGP attacks).  </li><li>E2E Security.  Inter-host communication must be end-to-end signed/encrypted and data must be stored signed/encrypted. Data is signed/encrypted in motion and at rest.  </li><li>E2E Provenance.  Data flow transformations must be end-to-end provenanced using verifiable data items (verifiable data chains or VCs). Every change shall be provenanced.  </li><li>Verify every-time for every-thing.  Every network interaction or data flow must be authenticated and authorized using best practice cryptography.  </li><li>Authorization is behavioral.  Policies for authentication and authorization must be dynamically modified based on behavior (reputation).  </li><li>No single point of trust.  Policies for authentication and authorization must be governed by end-verified diffuse-trust distributed consensus. Policy is protected by diffuse trust.  </li><li>Hosts locked down.  Hosts or host components executing any of the logic mentioned above must be locked down. Any changes to the host execution logic or behavior must be fully security tested and validated over the respective possible combinations of hardware and software platform. This means locking down key management and cryptographic operations on the devices. This includes key generation and storage, as well as signature generation and signature verification. These may benefit from the use of some form of trusted execution environment (TEE) either generally or specially as in a trusted platform module (TPM) or a hardware security module (HSM). In addition to key management and cryptographic operations, special security measures must be implemented regarding secure execution of the application logic (e.g. code injection, insecure object references, cross-site/service request forgery, cross-service scripting, etc.).</li></ol><p>Source: Universal Identity Theory by Samuel Smith</p><h4>Also see</h4><p><a href=\"zero-trust\">zero trust</a></p>",
