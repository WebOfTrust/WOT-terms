## KERI Request Authentication Mechanism

A non-interactive replay attack protection algorithm that uses a sliding window of date-time stamps and key state (similar to the tuple in BADA-RUN) but the date-time is the repliers not the queriers. KRAM is meant to protect a host. See the WebOfTrust glossary for more detail.
