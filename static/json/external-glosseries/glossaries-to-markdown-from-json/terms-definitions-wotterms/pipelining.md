## pipelining

<h4>Definition</h4><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing">computing</a>, a pipeline, also known as a data pipeline, is a set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a> processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one. The elements of a pipeline are often executed in parallel or in time-sliced fashion. Some amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_(computer_science)">buffer storage</a> is often inserted between elements.<br>More on source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)">Wikipedia-page</a></p><h4>Why CESR needs to anticipate pipelining</h4><p>If you have a stream coming in, you have to look ahead how big a chunk of data can be. We call this a logical atomic data chunk.</p><h5>JSON is slow</h5><p>With JSON I donâ€™t know where the end is, so I have to parse the initial stream to find out. That&#39;s slow.</p><h5>Meaning of Pipelining</h5><p>That once you have a block of data, that you can pull off chunks and de-multiplex from the stream into cores and multiplex them back into the streams. Cores in big datacenters are now max 5 GHz, a pipeline is 40 GHz. So you have to be able to do pipelining (split off over many cores). <a href="CESR">CESR</a> is the only streaming protocol that has this anticipation on board.<br>Source: Samuel Smith, KERI Zoom meeting Dec 5 2023.</p><h5>Related</h5><p><a href="multiplexing">Multiplexing</a></p>
