## authentic web

<h4>Definition</h4><p>The authentic web is the internet as a whole giant verifiable data structure. Also called <em>Web5</em>. The web will be one big graph. That&#39;s the mental model of the &#39;authentic web&#39;.</p><h4>Related</h4><ul><li><code>Signed at rest</code> - the data never throws away any signature of data. Because otherwise we can&#39;t validate data in the future</li><li><code>Key state at rest</code> - you need to solve this hard problem too. This is the hard problem <a href="KERI">KERI</a> solves.</li><li><code>Signed in motion</code> - signatures get thrown away. You use ephemeral identifiers. You have to do everything anew every time you want to reconstruct a verifiable data structure. Therefore we need &#39;Signed at rest&#39;.</li></ul><h4>Scalability of Key state at rest</h4><ul><li>You can append to any part of the (directed-acyclic) <a href="directed-acyclic-graph">graph</a></li><li>You can hop into the graph to verify any fragment of the graph</li><li>You don&#39;t have to sign the data,you just have to sign hashes of this data</li><li>Every tree that gets integrated in this giant graph-forest has its own <a href="root-of-trust">Root of Trust</a></li></ul><h4>KERI related</h4><p>KERI solves all hard problems of the authentic web in a scalable manner.</p><h4>Technically oriented deep dive</h4><p>See more in <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/blob/main/mental-model.md">Mental Model</a> of KERI suite and <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/blob/main/concepts.md">Concepts</a> behind KERI</p>
