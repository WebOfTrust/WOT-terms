### complementary integrity verification

<h4>Definition</h4><p>A mechanism that can verify integrity independent of needing access to a previous instance or reference version of the information for comparison.<br>Source: Neil Thomson</p><h4>Complementary nature</h4><p>Independent Integrity Verification is what is achieved by use of a public key from the data &quot;controller&quot; such that it does not need to compare received data/messages against the sent data/message.</p><p>The already verified chain up to a certain point in time in the past (previous instance or reference version) no longer needs to be verified.</p><blockquote><p>Example: The tail of a <a href="key-event-log">KEL</a> that has been verified to its <a href="root-of-trust">root-of-trust</a> on a certain date and time, can be cut off. You don&#39;t need to verify this any more from this date.</p></blockquote><h4>See also</h4><p><a href="integrity">integrity</a><br><a href="verified-integrity">verified integrity</a></p>
