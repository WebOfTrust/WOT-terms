## pseudo random number

<h4>Definition</h4><p>A (set of) value(s) or element(s) that is statistically random, but it is derived from a known starting point and is typically repeated over and over. Pseudo-random numbers provide necessary values for processes that require randomness, such as creating test signals or for synchronizing sending and receiving devices in a spread spectrum transmission. </p><p>It is called &quot;pseudo&quot; random, <strong>because the algorithm can repeat the sequence</strong>, and the numbers are thus not entirely random.<br><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/pseudo-random-numbers">Source</a></p>
