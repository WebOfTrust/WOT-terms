## self framing

<h4>Definition</h4><p>a textual encoding that includes type, size, and value is self-framing.<br>Source <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ssmith-cesr-02.txt">Samual M Smith</a></p><h4>Detailed explanation</h4><p>A self-framing text primitive may be parsed without needing any additional delimiting characters. Thus a stream of concatenated primitives may be individually parsed without the need to encapsulate the primitives inside textual delimiters or envelopes. Thus a textual self-framing encoding provides the core capability for a streaming text protocol like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_Text_Oriented_Messaging_Protocol">STOMP</a> or <a href="https://github.com/RaetProtocol/raet">RAET</a>.</p><h4>Related to CESR</h4><p>Although a first class textual encoding of cryptographic primitives is the primary motivation for the <a href="composable-event-streaming-representation">CESR</a> protocol defined herein, CESR is sufficiently flexible and extensible to support other useful data types, such as, integers of various sizes, floating point numbers, date-times as well as generic text. Thus this protocol is generally useful to encode in text data data structures of all types not merely those that contain cryptographic primitives.</p>
