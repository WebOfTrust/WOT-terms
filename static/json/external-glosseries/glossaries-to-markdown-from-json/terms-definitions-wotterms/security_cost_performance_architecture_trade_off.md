### security cost performance architecture trade off

<h4>Definition</h4><p>The degree of protection offered by a key management infrastructure usually forces a trade-off between security, cost, and performance.<br>Typically, key generation happens relatively infrequently compared to event signing. But highly secure key generation may not support highly performant signing. This creates an architecture trade-off problem.<br>Paraphrased from source <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/IdentifierTheory_web.pdf">Universal Identifier Theory</a> by Samuel Smith</p>
