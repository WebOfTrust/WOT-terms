## cold start stream parsing

<h4>Definition</h4><p>After a reboot (or cold start), a stream processor looks for framing information to know how to parse groups of elements in the stream. </p><p>If that framing information is ambiguous then the parser may become confused and require yet another cold start. While processing a given stream a parser may become confused especially if a portion of the stream is malformed in some way. This usually requires flushing the stream and forcing a cold start to resynchronize the parser to subsequent stream elements. </p><h4>re-synchronization</h4><p>Better than flushing the stream and forcing a cold start is a re-synchronization mechanism that does not require flushing the in-transit buffers but merely skipping to the next well-defined stream element boundary in order to execute a cold start.<br><em>See an example</em> in the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-cesr/blob/main/draft-ssmith-cesr.md#cold-start-stream-parsing-problem">source</a></p><h4>CESR related</h4><p>Special CESR count codes support re-synchronization at each boundary between interleaved CESR and other serializations like JSON, CBOR, or MGPK.</p>
