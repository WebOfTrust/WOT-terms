<h4>Definition</h4><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a>, a salt is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Number_Generator">random</a> data that is used as an additional input to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function">one-way function</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hashes</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)">data</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password">password</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase">passphrase</a>. </p><h5>Usage</h5><p>Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically, only a cryptographic hash function of the password was stored on a system, but over time, additional safeguards were developed to protect against duplicate or common passwords being identifiable (as their hashes are identical).<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)#cite_note-2">[2]</a> Salting is one such protection.</p><h5>More in source</h5><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)">Wikipedia</a></p>
