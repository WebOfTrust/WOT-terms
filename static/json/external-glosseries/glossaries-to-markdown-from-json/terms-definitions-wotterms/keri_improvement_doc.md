## keri improvement doc

<h4>Definition</h4><p>These docs are modular so teams of contributors can independently work and create PRs of individual KIDs; KIDs answer the question &quot;how we do it&quot;. We add commentary to the indivudual KIDs that elaborate on the why. It has been split from the how to not bother implementors with the why.</p>
