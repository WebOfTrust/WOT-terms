Leverage cooperative network effects</h5><p>How to remove primary barriers to cooperation? Different value contexts implies &#39;not directly competitive&#39;. So we need to find value that is transferrable between contexts. Therefore: Use trans-contextual value creation and capture to fuel cooperative network effects.</p><h5>2.
