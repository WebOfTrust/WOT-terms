## derivation code

<h4>Definition</h4><p>To properly extract and use the <a href="public-key-infrastructure">public key</a> embedded in a <a href="self-certifying-identifier">self-certifying identifier</a> we need to know the cryptographic <em>signing scheme</em> used by the <a href="key-pair">key pair</a>. KERI includes this very compactly in the identifier, by replacing the pad character (a character used to fill a void to able to always end up with a fixed length public key) with a special character that encodes the derivation process. We call this the <em>derivation code</em>.</p><h5>Example</h5><blockquote><p>For example suppose that the 44 character Base-64 with trailing pad character for the public key is as follows:<code>F5pxRJP6THrUtlDdhh07hJEDKrJxkcR9m5u1xs33bhp=</code>If B is the value of the derivation code then the resultant self-contained string is as follows:<code>BF5pxRJP6THrUtlDdhh07hJEDKrJxkcR9m5u1xs33bhp</code></p></blockquote><h5>Relation with KERI</h5><p>All crypto material appears in <code>KERI</code> in a fully <a href="qualified">qualified</a> representation. This includes a derivation code prepended to the crypto-material.<img src="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri/blob/main/images/derivation-code.png" alt=""></p><h6>Example KERI derivation codes</h6><p><img src="https://github.com/weboftrust/WOT-terms/static/img/derivation-code.png" alt="example derivation code in KERI"> </p><h4>Beware</h4><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">Key derivation functions</a> are not related to the pre-pended derivation codes used in KERI.</p>
