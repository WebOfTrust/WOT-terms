### post pad

<h4>Definition</h4><p>the action and / or result of extending a string with <em>trailing</em> pad characters to align to a certain length in bits or bytes.</p><h4>CESR related</h4><p>There are two ways to provide the required alignment on 24-bit boundaries to satisfy the <a href="composability">composability</a> property. One is <em>post-pad</em>, with trailing pad characters <code>=</code>, the text domain encoding to ensure that the text domain primitive has a total size (length) that is an integer multiple of 4. This is what <a href="naive-conversion">naive Base64 encoding</a> does.<br>The other way is to <a href="pre-pad">pre-pad</a> leading bytes of zeros to the raw binary value before conversion to Base64 to ensure the total size of the raw binary value with pre-pad bytes is an integer multiple of 3 bytes. This ensures that the size in characters of the Base64 conversion of the pre-padded raw binary is an integer multiple of 4 characters.<br><a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-cesr/blob/main/draft-ssmith-cesr.md#code-characters-and-lead-bytes">Source IEFT CESR draft</a></p>
