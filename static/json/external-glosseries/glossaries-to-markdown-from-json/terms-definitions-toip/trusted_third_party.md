## trusted third party

<p class="c8"><span>In </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.jhvr6rbo5z3q">cryptography</a></span><span>, a trusted </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.zu2vj8151tr">third party</a></span><span>&nbsp;(TTP) is an entity which facilitates interactions between two </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.cn6bno48fomj">parties</a></span><span>&nbsp;who both trust the </span><span>third party</span><span>; the </span><span>third party</span><span>&nbsp;reviews all critical transaction communications between the parties, based on the ease of creating fraudulent digital content. In TTP models, the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.61sr3qnr1eci">relying parties</a></span><span>&nbsp;use this trust to secure their own interactions. TTPs are common in any number of commercial transactions and in cryptographic digital transactions as well as cryptographic protocols, for example, a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.dm6pt5kg2uim">certificate authority</a></span><span>&nbsp;(CA) would issue a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.vpsiiv68xxwc">digital certificate</a></span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to one of the two parties in the next example. The CA then becomes the TTP to that certificate's issuance. Likewise transactions that need a third party recordation would also need a third-party repository service of some kind.</span></p><p class="c8"><span>Source: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_third_party&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1706779842900579&amp;usg=AOvVaw22cQL1DXHCUSbdMeQ0Ql7y">Wikipedia</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c8"><span>Also known as: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.v0r7skqmr47v">TTP</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c0">Supporting definitions:</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/trusted_third_party&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1706779842900986&amp;usg=AOvVaw2sc_0T93k1mLLX-NQHk0XC">NIST-CSRC</a></span><span>: A third party, such as a CA, that is trusted by its clients to perform certain services.
