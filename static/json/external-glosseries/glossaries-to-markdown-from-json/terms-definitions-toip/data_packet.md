### data packet

<p class="c8"><span>In </span><span>telecommunications</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>computer networking</span><span>, a network packet is a formatted unit of </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.o783ayrrkc6g">data</a></span><span>&nbsp;carried by a </span><span>packet-switched network such as the Internet</span><span>. A packet consists of control information and user </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.o783ayrrkc6g">data</a></span><span>; the latter is also known as the </span><span>payload</span><span>. Control information provides data for delivering the payload (e.g., source and destination </span><span>network addresses</span><span>, </span><span>error detection</span><span>&nbsp;codes, or sequencing information). Typically, control information is found in packet </span><span>headers</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>trailers</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c8"><span>Source: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1706779842586097&amp;usg=AOvVaw0dt7PT3z3nZA3z_z6muwer">Wikipedia</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
