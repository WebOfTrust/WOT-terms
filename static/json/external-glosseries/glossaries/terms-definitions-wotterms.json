The term takes its name from an allegory, the &quot;Byzantine Generals Problem&quot;, developed to describe a situation in which, in order to avoid catastrophic failure of the system, the system&#39;s actors must agree on a concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable.In a Byzantine fault, a component such as a server can inconsistently appear both failed and functioning to failure-detection systems, presenting different symptoms to different observers. It is difficult for the other components to declare it failed and shut it out of the network, because they need to first reach a consensus regarding which component has failed in the first place.Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is the dependability of a fault-tolerant computer system to such conditions.</p><h4>Consensus two third</h4><p>A system has Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) when it can keep functioning correctly as long as two-thirds of the network agree or reaches consensus.

    "definition": "<h4>Definition</h4><p>A controller is a controlling entity (person, organization, or autonomous software) of an identifier. For an <a href=\"autonomic-identifier\">autonomic identifier (AID)</a>, a controlling entity has the capability to make changes to the <a href=\"key-event-log\">key event log (KEL)</a> of the AID. This capability is typically asserted by the control of a set of cryptographic keys used by software acting on behalf of the controller, though it might also be asserted via other mechanisms.</p><p>At any point in time, an identifier has at least one but may have more than one controlling entity. This set of controlling entities constitutes the controller. Without loss of generality, when the context is unambiguous, the term controller may refer either to the whole set or a member of the set of controlling entities.</p><p>All <a href=\"key-event\">key events</a> on the identifier must include a signature from the sole controlling entity when there is only one controlling entity or at least one signature from one of the controlling entities when there is more than one. Typically, when there is more than one controlling entity, control is established via signatures from all or a subset of controlling entities. This is called <a href=\"multisig\">multi-signature (multi-sig)</a>. In a threshold multi-sig scheme, the control authority is split among the controlling entities, where each is assigned a weight. In this case, the control authority over the identifier is established via signatures from a subset of controlling entities whose combined weights exceed an agreed threshold. These thresholded multiple signatures may be expressed as a single collective threshold signature when a collective signing scheme is used.</p><p>The control authority over an identifier can also be divided into signing authority and rotation authority.

Delegation includes a delegator and a delegate. For this reason we may call this a cooperative delegation. This is a somewhat <strong>novel form of delegation</strong>. A major advantage of cooperative delegation is the delegator’s key management protects the delegate’s via recovery by the delegator.

The version count code determines which CESR table to load when parsing the stream. The <a href=\"sniffer\">sniffer</a> detects if CESR binary, CESR Text, JSON, CBOR, MGPK. If any of the last three then the parser regexes to find the version string inside the JSON, CBOR, and MGPK and from the version string extracts the number of characters/bytes that is the length of the JSON, CBOR, or MGPK. The parser then resumes sniffing. When the sniff is CESR then when at the top level looks for the CESR version count code or any other count codes. The interpretation of the count codes is dependent on the version count code that is why the Parser has to start with a default version count code because the stream may not begin with a version code or may have resumed after a cold restart. When a count code is parsed then the parser may descend into parsing whats inside group for a group count code which may recursively nest down a ways.<br>Source Slack Cesride thread: Feb 2 2023</p>"

In key management one may speak of revoking keys. With statement issuance, authorization issuance, or credential issuance, one may speak of revoking an authorization statement, a token, or a credential.<br>This becomes confusing when the act of revoking keys also implicitly revokes the <a href=\"authorization\">authorization</a> of statements signed with those keys. Any statement may be effectively authorized by virtue of the attached signature(s) made with a set of <a href=\"authoritative\">authoritative</a> keys. The statement itself may be authorizing some other function in the system. So, the verification of the signature on an authorizing statement is essential to determining the authoritativeness of the associated authorized function.

So one operation, rotate, is implemented instead of two operations (revoke and replace).<br><strong>A bare key revocation is indicated by replacement with a null key.</strong> So only one operation is needed, that is, rotate where a special case of rotation is to rotate to a null key.</p><h4>Also see</h4><p><a href=\"revocation-event\">Revocation event</a></p>"

Thus a stream of concatenated primitives may be individually parsed without the need to encapsulate the primitives inside textual delimiters or envelopes. Thus a textual self-framing encoding provides the core capability for a streaming text protocol like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_Text_Oriented_Messaging_Protocol\">STOMP</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/RaetProtocol/raet\">RAET</a>.</p><h4>Related to CESR</h4><p>Although a first class textual encoding of cryptographic primitives is the primary motivation for the <a href=\"composable-event-streaming-representation\">CESR</a> protocol defined herein, CESR is sufficiently flexible and extensible to support other useful data types, such as, integers of various sizes, floating point numbers, date-times as well as generic text.

    "definition": "<h4>Definition</h4><p>The threshold of accountable duplicity (TOAD) is a threshold number <code>M</code> that the controller declares to accept accountability for an event when any subset <code>M</code> of the <code>N</code> witnesses confirm that event. The threshold <code>M</code> indicates the minimum number of confirming witnesses the controller deems sufficient given some number <code>F</code> of potentially faulty witnesses, given that <code>M &gt;= N - F</code>. This enables a controller to provide itself with any degree of protection it deems necessary given this accountability.</p><p>Note that what may be sufficient for a controller may not be sufficient for a validator. To clarify, let <code>MC</code> denote the threshold size of a sufficient agreement from the perspective of a controller and let <code>MV</code> denote the threshold size of a sufficient agreement from the perspective of a validator. Typically, <code>MV &gt;= MC</code>. </p><h4>TOAD in KEL</h4><p>A controller declares TOAD in its <a href=\"key-event-log\">key event log (KEL)</a> during the <a href=\"inception-event\">key inception event</a> and may edit it during subsequent <a href=\"rotation-event\">key rotation events</a>.</p><h4>Purpose of TOAD</h4><p>A highly available system needs some degree of fault tolerance. The purpose of the threshold of accountability is to enable fault tolerance of the key event service with respect to faulty behavior by either the controller or witnesses. The principal controller fault exhibits duplicitous behavior in the use of its keys. In this case, the threshold serves as the threshold of accountable duplicity. The threshold lets a validator know when it may hold the controller accountable for duplicitous behavior. Without a threshold, a validator may choose to hold a controller accountable upon any evidence of duplicity which may make the service fragile in the presence of any degree of such faulty behavior. The primary way that a validator may hold a controller accountable is to stop trusting any use of the associated identifier. This destroys any value in the identifier and does not allow the controller to recover from an exploit. Recall that the one purpose of rotation keys (pre-rotated unexposed) is to enable recovery from compromised interaction signing keys. A compromised interaction signing key may exhibit duplicitous behavior on the part of the controller. A threshold of accountable duplicity enables a validator to distinguish between potentially recoverable duplicity such as the use of a compromised signing key and non-recoverable duplicity such as the use of a compromised rotation key. This better protects both the validator and the controller and improves the robustness of the service. </p>"

A valid statement MUST be verifiable, that is, has a verifiable signature from the current controlling keypair(s) at the time of its issuance. Therefore a Validator must first act as a Verifier in order to establish the root authoritative set of keys. Once verified, the Validator may apply other criteria or constraints to the statement in order to determine its validity for a given use case. When that statement is part of a verifiable data structure then the cryptographic verification includes verifying digests and any other structural commitments or constraints. To elaborate, with respect to an AID, for example, a Validator first evaluates one or more KELs in order to determine if it can rely on (trust) the key state (control authority) provided by any given KEL. A necessary but insufficient condition for a valid KEL is it is verifiable i.e. is internally inconsistent with respect to compliance with the KERI protocol. An invalid KEL from the perspective of a Validator may be either unverifiable or may be verifiable but duplicitous with respect to some other verifiable version of that KEL. Detected duplicity by a given validator means that the validator has seen more than one verifiable version of a KEL for a given AID. Reconciliable duplicity means that one and only one version of a KEL as seen by a Validator is accepted as the authoritative version for that validator. Irreconcilable duplicity means that none of the versions of a KEL as seen by a validator are accepted as the authoritative one for that validator. The conditions for reconcilable duplicity are described later.<br>Source <a href=\"https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri/blob/main/draft-ssmith-keri.md#basic-terminology\">Sam Smith</a></p><h4>ESSIF-lab definitions</h4><ul><li><em><a href=\"https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary#verify\">verify</a></em> definition is in sync with the definition in the KERI/ACDC vocabulary</li><li><em><a href=\"https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary#verifier\">verifier</a></em> definition is in sync with the definition in the KERI/ACDC vocabulary</li><li><em><a href=\"https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary#validate\">validate</a></em> definition is very general, however in the KERI/ACDC vocabulary &#39;validate&#39; currently has diverse meanings including this one</li><li><em><a href=\"https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary#validator\">validator</a></em> definition is a generalisation of the much more specific definition in the KERI/ACDC vocabulary</li></ul>"

These principles are described at more length elsewhere but may be summarized as follows:</p><ol><li>Network Hostility. The network is always hostile, internally &amp; externally; Locality is not trustworthy. Solutions must provide means to mitigate network layer security vulnerabilities (man-in-the-middle, DNS hijacking, BGP attacks).  </li><li>E2E Security.  Inter-host communication must be end-to-end signed/encrypted and data must be stored signed/encrypted. Data is signed/encrypted in motion and at rest.  </li><li>E2E Provenance.  Data flow transformations must be end-to-end provenanced using verifiable data items (verifiable data chains or VCs). Every change shall be provenanced.  </li><li>Verify every-time for every-thing.  Every network interaction or data flow must be authenticated and authorized using best practice cryptography.  </li><li>Authorization is behavioral.  Policies for authentication and authorization must be dynamically modified based on behavior (reputation).  </li><li>No single point of trust.  Policies for authentication and authorization must be governed by end-verified diffuse-trust distributed consensus. Policy is protected by diffuse trust.  </li><li>Hosts locked down.  Hosts or host components executing any of the logic mentioned above must be locked down. Any changes to the host execution logic or behavior must be fully security tested and validated over the respective possible combinations of hardware and software platform. This means locking down key management and cryptographic operations on the devices. This includes key generation and storage, as well as signature generation and signature verification. These may benefit from the use of some form of trusted execution environment (TEE) either generally or specially as in a trusted platform module (TPM) or a hardware security module (HSM). In addition to key management and cryptographic operations, special security measures must be implemented regarding secure execution of the application logic (e.g. code injection, insecure object references, cross-site/service request forgery, cross-service scripting, etc.).</li></ol><p>Source: Universal Identity Theory by Samuel Smith</p><h4>Also see</h4><p><a href=\"zero-trust\">zero trust</a></p>"
