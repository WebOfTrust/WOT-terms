**1 vLEI Issuer Qualification Program**

**Requirements**

**1.1 Qualification Program Eligibility**

Any organization in any geographic location may apply to become a Qualified vLEI Issuer with the
exception of a sole proprietorship or “natural person”.

An organization which does not successfully complete the Qualification Program due to timing
deadlines or a decision of GLEIF may re-apply for Qualification at a future date of its choosing.

**1.2 Fundamentals**

Every Candidate vLEI Issuer is required to complete successfully the Qualification Program in order to
achieve Qualified vLEI Issuer status. The Qualification Program evaluates a Candidate vLEI Issuer’s
financial, operational, and informational technology capabilities using the self-assessment
questionnaire provided by GLEIF which is referred to as the vLEI Issuer Qualification Program
Checklist. The specific areas of review are documented in this Manual.

GLEIF believes, as part of its founding principles, that every Candidate vLEI Issuer shall be treated in a
fully transparent manner with consistent processes and evaluation criteria.

**1.3 Certifications**

Organizations that hold any of the certificates specified in section B of the vLEI Issuer Qualification
Program Checklist may be subject to a simplified Qualification Program, which would allow skipping
certain sections of the vLEI Issuer Qualification Program Checklist document, where applicable.

The decision to all Candidate vLEI Issuers to skip sections of the vLEI Issuer Qualification Program
Checklist is at the sole discretion of GLEIF.

**1.4 Organizational Reputation**

GLEIF expects all vLEI Issuers to maintain a law abiding and ethical status in the business community.

Concerns or comments brought to GLEIF’s attention regarding Qualified vLEI Issuers will be
addressed as well as will be considered during Annual vLEI Issuer Qualification.

**1.5 Conflicts of Interest**

GLEIF defines a Conflict of Interest (COI) as:

“A set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgement or actions regarding a primary
interest will be unduly influences by secondary interest. Primary interest refers to the principal goals
of the profession or activity, such as the protection of clients or duties of public office. Secondary
interest includes not only financial gain but also such motives as the desire for professional
advancement and the wish to do favours for family and friends.”

Given the value and sensitivity of the services that Qualified vLEI Issuers provide, GLEIF will not
accept any degree of COI given the irredeemable reputational harm it could cause. The Candidate
vLEI Issuer is requested to report any potential COI situation to its GLEIF contact for the vLEI Issuer
Qualification Program of explain the circumstances, actions, and remediation implemented to
address COI.

**1.6 vLEI Issuer Requirements**

The vLEI Issuer requirements which Qualified vLEI Issuers must meet are defined in the vLEI
Ecosystem Governance Framework and in the vLEI Issuer Qualification Agreement and its
Appendices. Key topics GLEIF considers critical to be overall integrity of Qualified vLEI Issuer
operations have been included. These are reflected in the questions in the vLEI Issuer Qualification
Program Checklist.

When developing the vLEI Issuer Qualification Program Checklist, GLEIF considered and incorporated
generally accepted control standards referring to generally accepted from models such as ISO, COSO,
and COBIT.

**1.7 Qualification Program Processing Order**

Qualification Program processing order is based on a FIFO (First in First Out) principle depending on
the timeliness and completeness of the Candidate vLEI Issuer submissions. Applications which are
incomplete and/or require additional documentation may be impacted with significantly delayed
processing times which can affect the precedence of the application.

**1.8 Confidentiality**

Confidentiality is set out in the non-disclosure agreement.

**1.9 Continuous Improvement of Qualification**

GLEIF will evaluate Qualification Program criteria and process for best practices at least annually. Any
material changes to this Manual or the vLEI Issuer Qualification Checklist will be managed per the
terms of the vLEI Issuer Qualification Agreement, Section VIII, Agreement Change Process.

**1.10 Use of Third-Party Assessment Reports in Qualification**

The Candidate vLEI Issuer may integrate the control assessment and reporting requirements for
becoming a Qualified vLEI Issuer with independent auditing activity that is carried out with respect to
its organization(s). If a Candidate vLEI Issuer has a current third-party opinion/report from
independent, qualified internal auditors, external auditors or, regulatory auditors or independent
consultants with respect to the subjects included in the Qualification Program Checklist, these
reports may be submitted as evidence as the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls. The
Candidate vLEI Issuer must cross-reference such opinions/reports to the appropriate Qualification
Program Checklist item and provide direct responses to questions about areas not included in these
opinions/reports.

**1.11 Use of Third-Party Service Providers as a Qualified vLEI Issuer**

The Qualified vLEI Issuer may utilize third-party service providers for certain functions such as
running portions of or its IT, operational infrastructure, and administrative functions (e.g., finance,
HR) unrelated to vLEI services. The terms and conditions for this are detailed in the vLEI Issuer
Qualification Agreement Section III. B, Use of Third-Party Services.

**1.12 Letters of Assurance**

It is critical that a Qualified vLEI Issuer maintain its financial viability both in practical terms as well as
with respect to the reputation of the Global Legal Entity Identifier System (GLEIS) as a whole. When
performing its financial assessment, GLEIF will evaluate both independent information, such as audit
reports, as well as unverified information from these reports. This information may be considered as
evidence as to the adequacy and effectiveness of internal controls of the Candidate vLEI Issuer, such
as operating budgets.

GLEIF, at its sole discretion, may require a Candidate vLEI Issuer to provide a letter of assurance,
guarantee or confirmation of financial sources and/or support from the Candidate vLEI Issuer’s
parent organization(s) indicating its ultimate responsibility for the Candidate vLEI Issuer’s financial
soundness. If such a document is not provided upon request, GLEIF, at its sole discretion may
terminate the qualification program of the Candidate vLEI Issuer.

financial, operational, and technical requirements of the GLEIF and that a Qualified vLEI Issuer’s
control environment has reasonable risk mitigation to protect the integrity of the vLEI operations.

Throughout the Qualification Program, the Candidate vLEI Issuer is obliged to inform GLEIF without
undue delay about any events or developments which affect the accuracy of information provided to
GLEIF such as changes in legal status e.g., form of incorporation, change of signatory power of its
officers and the like. Such changes could impact the Qualification Program and/or any agreed time
schedule.

Candidate vLEI Issuers submit all Qualification Program materials via a communications portal
provided by GLEIF. All documents received are date stamped and receipts sent to the representative
of the submitting Candidate vLEI Issuer. Once information and documentation are designated as
‘FINAL’, the communications portal is restricted to read-only for users and any proposed changes will
need to be discussed with and approved by GLEIF before taking any action.

The Qualification Program is comprised of the steps.

**3.2 Qualification Program Support**

In order to provide for fairness to all Candidate vLEI Issuers, GLEIF does not provide consultative
advice to Candidate vLEI Issuers regarding their response to the vLEI Issuer Qualification Program
Checklist, information and/or documents. GLEIF expects that the definitions and information on its
website serve this purpose. However, a Candidate vLEI Issuer may, upon request, schedule up to two
(2) review sessions with GLEIF during the Qualification Program process for the purpose of clarifying
program issues and requirements. Each call will be planned for a maximum of one hour's duration.

GLEIF reserves the right to request and schedule review meetings for clarification and will follow the
same procedure of providing the Candidate vLEI Issuer with a list of questions in advance depending
on the subject and circumstances and setting a mutually agreeable schedule.

For purposes of clarity,

“Government” refers to a Candidate vLEI Issuer which is, or is part of, an administrative agency,
nation state or state-owned company.

“Private” is a privately controlled legal entity which is not listed on stock exchange.

“Public-listed” is an entity which is listed on a stock exchange and has shareholders.

“Public-Non-Listed” is an entity which is funded from public sources but does not have stockholders.

“Account Framework” and “Internal Controls Framework” refer to commonly recognized business
models in use globally. This is helpful but not essential information.

The Candidate vLEI Issuer is asked to identify any beneficiary ownership associated with their
organization.

This section asks the Candidate vLEI Issuer to describe its current audit activities from a variety of
sources. This may aid the Candidate vLEI Issuer in identifying any current report from a third-party
that could be used to confirm the adequacy of internal controls independent of the organization.
These reports may be accepted by GLEIF in lieu of other documentation if current and relating to vLEI
Issuer services.

**Section C Organization Structure**

The purpose of this section is to inform the Candidate vLEI Issuer as to the types of
information/reports which will either be required or may be helpful during the Qualification Process.
A key point to note is that distinctions are made as to what reports would generally be expected to
be in place for certain types of organization. See the “Applicability” columns.

**Section D Financial Data, Audits & General Governance**

The purpose of this section is to provide GLEIF with an overview of certain financial and operational
aspects of the Candidate vLEI Issuer.

A key point to note is that the Candidate vLEI Issuer must explain clearly how its intended vLEI Issuer
operations will be structured within an organization. For example, it could be a stand-alone entity
with no other affiliations. It could also be a department/function within another organization.

This section applies to the Candidate vLEI Issuer in the context of its parent/owner/controlling entity,
if applicable. All relevant entities need to be represented in the Candidate vLEI Issuer’s answers.
