# Introduction

This is a Controlled Document of the GLEIF verifiable LEI (vLEI)
Ecosystem Governance Framework. It is the authoritative Governance
Framework for the purpose, principles, policies, and specifications that
apply to the use of the GLEIF Root Autonomic Identifier (AID) and its
GLEIF Delegated AIDs in the vLEI Ecosystem.

# Terminology

All terms in First Letter Capitals are defined in the vLEI Glossary.

# Purpose

The GLEIF Root AID provides the Root of Trust for the ecosystem tree of
trust. Each branch in that tree is a Chain of Trust. The Delegated AID
Chain of Trust branch provides trust for delegated GLEIF AIDs and
Qualified vLEI Issuer Delegated AIDs. The vLEI Chain of Trust branch,
that attaches to the Delegated AID Chain of Trust branch, provides trust
for all vLEIs within the vLEI ecosystem.

# Scope

The scope of this Identifier Governance Framework is limited to the
GLEIF Root AID and its Delegated AIDs.

# Principles

The following principles guide the development of policies in this
Identifier Governance Framework. Note that they apply **in addition to**
the Core Policies defined in the vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework.

## Highest Duty of Care

GLEIF shall exercise the highest duty of care in generating and
administering the GLEIF AID and all its Delegated AIDs as these are the
security foundation of the entire vLEI Ecosystem.

## Self-Certifying (Autonomic) Identifiers

All identifiers in the vLEI Ecosystem shall be self-certifying
identifiers (specifically KERI Autonomic Identifiers or AIDs), i.e., it
must be possible to verify directly using cryptography alone as defined
by the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) protocol that the
identifier was generated from a specific set of cryptographic key
pair(s).

## Cryptographic Root of Trust

All AIDs in the vLEI Ecosystem shall be generated from a random number
seed large enough to provide adequate cryptographic security for the
branch of the tree of trust that provides the Chain of Trust for which a
given AID is the head.

# AID Generation

1.  An AID conformant with this Governance Framework MUST be created
    from two sets of asymmetric signing key pairs generated from a
    cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator (SPRNG) or a
    true random number generator with at least 128 bits of cryptographic
    Root (see section 3.1 of Technical Requirements Part 1 KERI
    Infrastructure).

2.  The AID MUST then be derived from a cryptographic digest of a
    serialization of the public keys of the first set of key pairs and a
    cryptographic digest of second set of key pairs, as well as any
    other identifiers and configuration parameters associated with the
    supporting infrastructure for the Root Identifier as specified in
    the Technical Requirements Part 1 KERI Infrastructure.

3.  The cryptographic digest MUST have at least 128 bits of
    cryptographic strength.

# AID Controllers

1.  All Controllers MUST establish their own Private Key Store.

2.  All Controllers MUST keep their private keys secret.

3.  A given Controller MUST control one and only one key pair from each
    set of keys.

4.  The KERI protocol MUST be used to transfer control authority from
    one set of keys to another.

5.  Continuity and Survivorship

    a. GLEIF MUST have a Continuity Policy for the survival of control
    authority of all Controllers for the GLEIF Root AID and its
    Delegated AIDs, including Escrow Agents.

    b. QVIs and Legal Entities SHOULD have a Continuity Policy for the
    survival of control authority of their Controllers.

# GLEIF AID Genesis

The policies in this section apply to the genesis event for the GLEIF
Root AID, the GLEIF Internal Delegated AID (GIDA) and the GLEIF External
Delegated AID (GEDA).

1.  GLEIF MUST establish a list of initial GLEIF Controllers that
    specifies:

    a. The legal identity of each Controller.

    b. Which Controllers shall control the GLEIF Root AID, the GIDA and
    the GEDA.

    c. A set of policies MUST be put in place that ensure
    fault-tolerance with respect to common mode failures of the
    multi-sig signing authority of the set of GLEIF Controllers,
    e.g., a Designated Survivor policy and/or restrictions on joint
    travel and in-person attendance of meetings).

2.  GLEIF MUST establish ~~a~~ real-time Out-of-Band Interaction (OOBI)
    session(s) in which all initial GLEIF Controllers are present. An
    example is a continuous web meeting attended by all parties on both
    audio and video. The essential feature is that there is a mutual
    live presentation by all participants that verifies their live
    participation in the session.

    a. ~~This~~ Each session MUST be recorded, and the recording stored
    in high-security storage.

3.  All GLEIF Controllers MUST mutually authenticate each other's legal
    identities before proceeding with any further steps. An example is
    each Controller visually presenting one or more legal identity
    credentials for all other Controllers to verify against the list of
    initial GLEIF Controllers.

4.  The Root AID GLEIF Authorized Representative, the Internal Delegated
    AID GLEIF Authorized Representative and the External Delegated AID
    GLEIF Authorized Representative are GLEIF Controllers.

5.  Creation of GLEIF Root AID

    The following steps MUST be performed in the order listed and
    completed during ~~this~~ each OOBI session for the GLEIF Root AID.

    a. Each Root AID GLEIF Authorized Representative (Root GAR) MUST
    generate its own single signature AID that is a participating
    member in the group of AIDs that will be used to create the
    GLEIF Root AID.

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```

    a. Each Root GAR MUST use an OOBI protocol (such as a QR code or
    live chat) to share its own AID and Service Endpoints with the
    other Root GAR. For each Root GAR this provides the
    participating AID and the service endpoint whereby the other
    Root GARs may obtain the Key Event Log (KEL) of its
    participating AID.

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```

    b. Each Root GAR MUST send a Challenge Message to every other Root
    GAR as defined in the Technical Requirements Part 1 for the
    purposes of cryptographic authentication of their Root GAR AID.
    The Challenge Message MUST be unique to ~~the~~ each OOBI
    session.

    c. Each Root GAR MUST verify in real time that a response to the
    Challenge Message was received from every other Root GAR.

    d. Each Root GAR MUST verify the signature of every other Root GAR.

    e. One of the Root GARs MUST be designated as the Root AID GLEIF
    Authorized Representative Lead (Root GAR Lead).

    f. The Root GAR Lead MUST select the AIDs from the set of Root GAR
    s for the ordered set of authorized participant members in the
    multi-sig group and configure and approve the weight threshold
    and ordered set of participants for both the current and next
    set and threshold of participants.

    g. The Root GAR Lead MUST select the AIDs and Service Endpoints for
    the GLEIF Root AID Witness Pool.

    h. Using the current public key and the next public key digest from
    each of the participating AID Inception Events and the Root
    Witness AIDs, the Root GAR Lead MUST generate the GLEIF Root AID
    Inception Event and publish this to the other Root GARs and to
    the Root AID Witnesses designated by that Inception Event. The
    published Inception Event includes as an attachment OOBIs for
    each of the Root AID Witnesses.

    i. Each Root GAR MUST verify the set of public keys, the next
    public key digest, the threshold, the next threshold, and Root
    AID Witness identifiers in the Root AID Inception Event.

    j. Each Root GAR MUST verify the set of service endpoints for the
    Root AID Witnesses.

    k. Each Root GAR MUST sign and publish to the Root AID Witnesses
    their signature on the Root AID Inception Event.

    l. Each Root GAR MUST verify that the Root AID Inception Event is
    fully witnessed by every Root AID Witness.

6.  Creation of the GLEIF Internal Delegated AIDs

    The following steps MUST be performed in the order listed and
    completed during ~~this~~ each OOBI session for each of the two
    GLEIF Delegated AIDs, namely, the GLEIF Internal Delegated AID
    (GIDA) in this section, and the GLEIF External Delegated AID (GEDA)
    in section 7.

    a. Each Internal Delegated AID GLEIF Authorized Representative
    (Internal GAR) that is a participating member in the group of
    AIDs MUST generate its own single signature AID that will be
    used to create the GIDA.

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```

    a. Each Internal GAR MUST use an OOBI protocol (such as a QR code
    or live chat) to share its own AID and Service Endpoints with
    the other Internal GARs. For each Internal GAR, this provides
    the participating AID and the service endpoint whereby the other
    Internal GARs may obtain the KEL of its participating AID.

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```

    b. Each Internal GAR MUST send a Challenge Message to every other
    Internal GAR as defined in the Technical Requirements Part 1
    KERI Infrastructure for the purposes of cryptographic
    authentication of their GIDA. The Challenge Message MUST be
    unique to ~~the~~ each OOBI session.

    c. Each Internal GAR MUST verify in real time that a response to
    the Challenge Message was received from every other Internal
    GAR.

    d. Each Internal GAR MUST verify the signature of every other
    Internal GAR.

    e. One of the Internal GAR s MUST be designated as the Internal
    Delegated AID GLEIF Authorized Representative (Internal GAR
    Lead)

    f. The Internal GAR Lead MUST select the AIDs and Service Endpoints
    for the GLEIF Internal Delegated AID Witness Pool.

    g. The Internal GAR Lead MUST select the AIDs from the set of
    Internal GAR for the ordered set of authorized participant
    members in the multi-sig group and configure and approve the
    weight threshold and ordered set of participants for both the
    current and next set and threshold of participants.

    h. Using the current public key and the next public key digest from
    each of the participating AID Inception Events, the Internal
    Delegated Witness AIDs, and the GLEIF Root AID, the Internal GAR
    Lead MUST generate the GLEIF Internal Delegated AID Inception
    Event and publish this to the other Internal GARs and to the
    Delegated AID Witnesses designated by that Inception Event. The
    published Inception Event includes as an attachment OOBIs for
    each of the Internal Delegated AID Witnesses.

    i. Each Internal GAR MUST verify the set of public keys, the next
    public key digest, the Witness identifiers, the threshold, the
    next threshold, and the Root AID in the Internal Delegated AID
    Inception Event.

    j. Each Internal GAR MUST verify the set of Witness endpoints for
    the GIDA.

    k. Each Internal GAR MUST sign and publish to the Internal
    Delegated AID Witnesses its signature on the Internal Delegated
    AID Inception Event.

    l. Each Internal GAR MUST verify that the Internal Delegated AID
    Inception Event is fully witnessed by every Witness.

7.  Creation of the GLEIF External Delegated AIDs

    The following steps MUST be performed in the order listed and
    completed during ~~this~~ each OOBI session for each of the two
    GLEIF Delegated AIDs, namely, the GLEIF Internal Delegated AID
    (GIDA) in section 6 and the GLEIF External Delegated AID (GEDA) in
    this section.

    a. Each External Delegated AID GLEIF Authorized Representative
    (External GAR) that is a participating member in the group of
    AIDs MUST generate its own single signature AID that will be
    used to create the GEDA.

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```

    a. Each External GAR MUST use an OOBI protocol (such as a QR code
    or live chat) to share its own AID and Service Endpoints with
    the other External GARs. For each External GAR, this provides
    the participating AID and the service endpoint whereby the other
    External GARs may obtain the KEL of its participating AID.

    ```{=html}
    <!-- -->
    ```

    b. Each External GAR MUST send a Challenge Message to every other
    External GAR as defined in the Technical Requirements Part 1
    KERI Infrastructure for the purposes of cryptographic
    authentication of their GEDA. The Challenge Message MUST be
    unique to ~~the~~ each OOBI session.

    c. Each External GAR MUST verify in real time that a response to
    the Challenge Message was received from every other External
    GAR.

    d. Each External GAR MUST verify the signature of every other
    External GAR.

    e. One of the External GARs MUST be designated as the External
    Delegated AID GLEIF Authorized Representative Lead (External GAR
    Lead).

    f. The External GAR Lead MUST select the AIDs and Service Endpoints
    for the GLEIF External Delegated AID Witness Pool.

    g. The External GAR Lead MUST select the AIDs from the set of
    External GARs for the ordered set of authorized participant
    members in the multi-sig group and configure and approve the
    weight threshold and ordered set of participants for both the
    current and next set and threshold of participants.

    h. Using the current public key and the next public key digest from
    each of the participating AID Inception Events, the External
    Delegated Witness AIDs, and the GLEIF Root AID, or the External
    GAR Lead MUST generate the GLEIF External Delegated AID
    Inception Event and publish this to the other External GARs and
    to the External Delegated AID Witnesses designated by that
    Inception Event. The published Inception Event includes as an
    attachment OOBIs for each of the External Delegated AID
    Witnesses.

    i. Each External GAR MUST verify the set of public keys, the next
    public key digest, the Witness identifiers, the threshold, the
    next threshold, and the Root AID in the External Delegated AID
    Inception Event.

    j. Each External GAR MUST verify the set of Witness endpoints for
    the GEDA.

    k. Each External GAR MUST sign and publish to the External
    Delegated AID Witnesses their signature on the External
    Delegated AID Inception Event.

    l. Each External GAR MUST verify that the External Delegated AID
    Inception Event is fully witnessed by every Witness.

8.  Rotation Event to delegate the GLEIF Internal Delegated AIDs

    The following steps MUST be performed in the order listed and
    completed during this OOBI session for each of the two GLEIF
    Delegated AIDs, namely, the GLEIF Internal Delegated AID (GIDA) in
    this section and the GLEIF External Delegated AID (GEDA) in section 9.

    The anchor in this Rotation Event is the mechanism by which the
    delegation is authorized by the Delegator. The Rotation Event with
    the anchoring digest of the Inception Event of the Delegated AID,
    when Fully Signed, is a verifiable cryptographic commitment to the
    delegation. The Delegated AIDs are not verifiable until they are
    anchored in the KEL of the Delegator e.g., the Root AID. A new event
    must be created to include these anchors.

    (Delegation in KERI is cooperative. It requires a cryptographic
    commitment from both the Delegator and the Delegate.)

    a. A threshold satisficing subset of Internal GARs MUST each rotate
    their participating AIDs.

    b. Using the current public key, the next public key digest from
    each of the participating AID Rotation Events, and the digest of
    the GLEIF Internal Delegated AID Inception Event, the Internal
    GAR Lead MUST generate a GLEIF Internal Delegated AID Rotation
    Event and publish this to the other participating Internal GARs
    and to the Root AID Witnesses.

    c. Each Internal GAR MUST verify the set of public keys, the next
    public key digest, and delegated Inception Event digests in that
    Rotation Event.

    d. Each Internal GAR MUST sign and publish to the Root AID
    Witnesses their signature on the Root AID Rotation Event.

    e. Each Internal GAR MUST verify that the Root AID Rotation Event
    is fully witnessed by every Root AID Witness.

9.  Rotation Event to delegate the GLEIF External Delegated AIDs

    The following steps MUST be performed in the order listed and
    completed during this OOBI session for each of the two GLEIF
    Delegated AIDs, namely, the GLEIF Internal Delegated AID (GIDA) in
    section 8 and the GLEIF External Delegated AID (GEDA) on this
    section.

    The anchor in this Rotation Event is the mechanism by which the
    delegation is authorized by the Delegator. The Rotation Event with
    the anchoring digest of the Inception Event of the Delegated AID,
    when Fully Signed, is a verifiable cryptographic commitment to the
    delegation. The Delegated AIDs are not verifiable until they are
    anchored in the KEL of the Delegator e.g. the Root AID. A new event
    must be created to include these anchors.

    (Delegation in KERI is cooperative. It requires a cryptographic
    commitment from both the Delegator and the Delegate.)

    a. A threshold satisficing subset of External GARs MUST each rotate
    their participating AIDs.

    b. Using the current public key, the next public key digest from
    each of the participating AID Rotation Events, and the digest of
    GLEIF External Delegated AID Inception Event, the External GAR
    Lead MUST generate a GLEIF External Delegated AID Rotation Event
    and publish this to the other participating External GARs and to
    the Root AID Witnesses.

    c. Each External GAR MUST verify the set of public keys, the next
    public key digest, and delegated Inception Event digests in that
    Rotation Event.

    d. Each External GAR MUST sign and publish to the Root AID
    Witnesses their signature on the Root AID Rotation Event.

    e. Each External GAR MUST verify that the Root AID Rotation Event
    is fully witnessed by every Root AID Witness.

    f. Each participating External GAR MUST verify the delegated
    Inception Event digest in that Interaction Event.

    g. Each participating External GAR MUST sign and publish to the
    GLEIF External Delegated AID Witnesses their signature on the
    GLEIF External Delegated AID Interaction Event.

    h. Each participating External GAR MUST verify that the GLEIF
    External Delegated AID Interaction Event is fully witnessed by
    every Witness.

# Publication of GLEIF Root AID and GLEIF Delegated AIDs

1.  The GLEIF Root AID and GLEIF Delegated Internal and External AIDs
    MUST be published in a sufficiently strongly correlated and
    fault-tolerant manner to establish them as unique AIDs for GLEIF.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

10. The set of publication points MUST include at least 4 of the list of
    publication points initially (highlighted below) following the
    creation of the GLEIF Root AID and GLEIF Delegated Internal and
    External AIDs.

    a. The GLEIF HTTPS website.

    b. The HTTPS website of the GLEIF Regulatory Oversight Committee.

    c. The HTTPS websites of all QVIs.

    d. In the KERI Event Log for all GLEIF KERI Witnesses.

    e. Published to at least 3 international newspapers in separate
    national jurisdictions (applies only to the GLEIF Root AID).

        These publications are: Financial Times (London), The Wall
        Street Journal (American editon) and Regulation Asia.

    f. Published to github repositories

        The Web of Trust github repository

        Public GLEIF-controlled github repository

    g. Published to public registries

        IANA (IETF RFCs) registries

        ISO registries

# Abandonment

1.  Voluntary abandonment

> GLEIF MUST abandon its GLEIF Root AID if GLEIF no longer holds the
> role of root of trust for the vLEI Ecosystem.

2.  Private key compromise or natural disaster

> If in the extremely unlikely event of the failure of all key recovery
> provisions specified in Technical Requirements Part 1: KERI
> Infrastructure, GLEIF MUST abandon its Root AID and Delegated Internal
> and External AIDs and create and publish its new Root AID and
> Delegated Internal and External AIDs.
