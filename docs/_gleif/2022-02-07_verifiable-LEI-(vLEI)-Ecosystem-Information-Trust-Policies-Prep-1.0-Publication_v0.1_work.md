### 1 Introduction

This is a Controlled Document of the GLEIF vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework (vLEI

Ecosystem Governance Framework). The document defines the information security,

privacy, availability and confidentiality policies that apply to all vLEI Ecosystem stakeholders

regardless of their particular role or the particular type of vLEI being exchanged. Policies that

apply to the issuance, holding, or verification of a specific type of vLEI are defined in the vLEI
Credential Governance Framework for that credential type.

### 2 Terminology

All terms in First Letter Capitals are defined in the vLEI Glossary.

### 3 Regulatory Compliance

vLEI Ecosystem stakeholders MUST comply with any governmental regulations for
information security to which their activities within the vLEI Ecosystem will be subject. This
includes International or trans-national governance authorities (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001 –
Information Security Management, EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

### 4 vLEI Ecosystem Stakeholder Privacy Policies

1. Legal Entities that receive vLEI Legal Entity Credentials SHOULD ensure that their
   privacy policies adequately protect the persons to whom the Legal Entity requests
   Legal Entity Official Organizational Role vLEI Credentials and Legal Entity
   Engagement Context Role vLEI Credentials.

2. The vLEI Ecosystem Credential Governance Frameworks MUST specify the
   information to be protected by the applicable privacy policy in the jurisdiction of the
   Legal Entity.

### 5 vLEI Ecosystem Stakeholder Data Protection

### Policies

1. vLEI Ecosystem stakeholders MUST confirm that they respect and comply with data
   protection legislation as applicable and in force.
2. Where no such legislation is in force, and as a material minimum standard, vLEI
   Ecosystem stakeholders MUST comply with the provisions of the Swiss Federal Data
   Protection Act specified in the Appendix to this policy document.
3. vLEI Ecosystem stakeholders MAY use Personal Data for the purpose of performing
   their obligations and rights under this Agreement. vLEI Ecosystem stakeholders
   MUST comply with:
   a. the material applicability of the provisions of the Swiss Federal Data
   Protection Act or
   b. about local data protection legislation applicable to the vLEI Ecosystem
   stakeholder if such legislation is equivalent or more rigorous.
4. Qualified vLEI Issuers MUST annually review and document that the provisions are
   implemented and enforced. Other vLEI Ecosystem stakeholders SHOULD undertake
   to regularly review and ensure that the provisions of this Section 5 are implemented
   and enforced.
5. When a privacy breach is suspected, the involved vLEI Ecosystem stakeholders MUST
   inform each other about actual or potential disclosure(s) of Personal Data and
   promptly take appropriate measures to address the situation and to limit the risk of
   such disclosure(s) from reoccurrence.
6. Qualified vLEI Issuers MUST document privacy breaches in an Incident Report.

### 6 vLEI Ecosystem Stakeholder Security Policies

1. vLEI Ecosystem stakeholders MUST publish, review annually, maintain, and comply
   with IT security policies and practices sufficient to protect all services that a vLEI
   Ecosystem stakeholder provides in conformance with this Ecosystem Governance
   Framework and meets the minimum elements of the following recommendations:

```

2. These policies MUST be mandatory for all employees of the vLEI Ecosystem
   stakeholder involved with vLEI Data. The vLEI Ecosystem stakeholder MUST
   designate its Information Security Manager or another officer to provide executive
   oversight for such policies, including formal governance and revision management,
   employee education, and compliance enforcement.
3. vLEI Ecosystem stakeholder employment verification policies and procedures MUST
   include, but may not be limited to, criminal background check and proof of identity
   validation.
4. Qualified vLEI Issuers MUST recertify annually that they maintain a law abiding and
   ethical status in the business community as evidenced in the Annual vLEI Issuer
   Qualification.
5. If a Qualified vLEI Issuer performs handling of vLEI Data in its own data center, the
   Qualified vLEI Issuer’s security policies MUST also adequately address physical
   security and entry control according to industry best practices.
6. If a Qualified vLEI Issuer uses providers of Third-Party Services in functions that
   involve the handling of vLEI Data, the Qualified vLEI Issuer MUST ensure that the
   security, privacy, and data protection policies of the third-party providers meet the
   requirements in this document.
7. Qualified vLEI Issuers MUST make available evidence of stated compliance with
   these policies and any relevant accreditations held by the Qualified vLEI Issuer
   during Annual vLEI Issuer Qualification, including certificates, attestations, or reports
   resulting from accredited third-party audits, such as ISO 27001, Statement on
   Standards for Attestation Engagements Service Organization Controls 2 (SSAE SOC
   2), or other industry standards.

### 7 Security Incidents Policies

1. Qualified vLEI Issuers MUST maintain and follow documented incident response
   procedures and guidelines for computer security incident handling and will comply
   with data breach notification terms of the vLEI Issuer Qualification Agreement. ITIL
   (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) Incident Management is followed by
   GLEIF and is certified as part of GLEIF’s ISO 20000 certification.
2. Qualified vLEI Issuers MUST define and execute an appropriate response plan to
   investigate suspected unauthorized access to vLEI data. GLEIF and the Qualified vLEI
   Issuers will handle through the Incident Management process.
