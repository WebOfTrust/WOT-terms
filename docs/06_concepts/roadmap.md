## Roadmap to know what's coming

In open source development there's a balance between speed of development and backward compatibility on one hand and a reliable codebase for production purposes on the other.

The KERI development team anno 2024 isn't a big fully funded development team. Currently we have to rely on a handful of very dedicated developers, and we do so happily and gratefully.

This means we can't expect the impossible from people. These are a few examples of which we are simply not able to comply with:
- backward compatibility of the codebase
- feature synced codebases in several programming language
- fully operational CDCI strategies 

Having writing this, we are still able to make some predictions about what'll be happening in the next year and there after. Mind you, garantueed to the front door and we're always happy to see PR requests coming in to smoothen the path to KERI Suite's maturity.

### Goals for 2024 and onwards
1. Feature complete to the KERI core spec and the Trust-over-IP Technological Stack, then
2. Versioning of the KERI core functionality

### For whom
- A. developers building on stable version and development versions of the KERI suite
- B. implementers that rely on stable versions of KERI

### Why mind the roadmap
- A. breaking changes, conflicting concepts and merge conflicts of development branches. 
- B. breaking changes to older stable versions that are already in use

### Issues
To modify and update our Roadmap, we regularly go through Keripy Issues (start of 2024: 130+):
1. what is obsolete / done already
2. what needs to preceed other issues (triggers)
3. Most important / most urgent

## Roadmap
Below we present timing and links to the actual issues in the [Keripy github repo](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy). Plan: when we plan the activity, not the result. However, if we plan an activity that has a preceding trigger activity you could rightfully understand that we plan to have completed the prior activity enough to be able to go forward.

Mind you: no guarantees can be given, we cannot take responsibility for commitments / expectations you derive from our roadmap.
