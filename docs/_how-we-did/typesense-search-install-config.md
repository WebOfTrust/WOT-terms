# Typesense search install and configuration

What is this: the necessary Typesense search engine *commands and configs* to serve the KERISSE site best

For who: maintainers and search engine configurators that want a head start and learn from *how-we-did* it for the KERI Suite Search Engine

Objective: because the search engine software is not our core business we chose to organise this away from us as far as possible. So we hire Typesense hosting | TBW link |

Result: A configuration that automatically indexes all native and scraped content in a way that we integrate pre-configured features with every run, like:
- overrides
- synonyms
- nearby vector searches
- ranking
- filtering options

## Subscription Typesense free account
These are the instructions we followed and implemented in the site, from Oct 2022.
