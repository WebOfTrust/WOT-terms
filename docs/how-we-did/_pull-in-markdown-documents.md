# Pull in markdown documents

`IETF drafts` are standardized write-ups for experts. Although these drafts contain valuable information and learning resources, the layout and accessibility is cumbersome for training and education purposes.
Therefore we pull in the original documents in markdown format in our Docusaurus site and semi-automatically reorganize the data using our Terms and Glossaries.

## How to find a document

Search the [WebofTrust Github repos](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri/blob/main) for an interesting resource.

## Save the doc as a 'raw' .md file

### Where?

In your local copy of the repository WebofTrust [WOT-terms](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms) It MUST be in:

- the `docs` directory of the Docusaurus site.
- In the `gh-pages` branch

## Next?

We are going to process this document with shell scripts and Docusaurus to produce a copy of the documents in a static Docusaurus website that has sidebars, filter options, automatic links in text to the glossary etc.
