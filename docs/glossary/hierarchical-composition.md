## Definition
Encoding protocol that is composable in a hierarchy and enables [pipelining](pipelining) (multiplexing and de-multiplexing) of complex streams in either text or compact binary. This allows management at scale for high-bandwidth applications.

## Example

## CESR related
Because of [count codes](count-code) and the [composability](composability) - and [concatenation](concatenation) property in CESR, [pipelining](pipelining) is possible, which then uses [multiplexing](multiplexing) (combining [self-framing](self-framing) primitives) and _de-multiplexing_ (unravelling self-framing [primitives](primitives)).
