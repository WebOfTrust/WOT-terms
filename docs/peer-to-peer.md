## Definition

Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a [distributed application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_application) architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. Peers are **equally privileged**, [equipotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equipotent) participants in the network. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking))
