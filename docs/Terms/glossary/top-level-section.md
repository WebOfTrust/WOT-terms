## Definition

The fields of an ACDC in [compact variant](compact-variant.md). The value of a top level section field is either the SAD or the SAID of the SAD of the associated section.
An Issuer commitment via a signature to any variant of ACDC (compact, full, etc) makes a cryptographic commitment to the top-level section fields shared by all variants of that ACDC.\
