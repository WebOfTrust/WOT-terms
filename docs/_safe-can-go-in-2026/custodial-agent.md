# custodial agent
## Definition
An [agent](agent) owned by an individual who has granted [signing authority](signing-authority) to a custodian who is usually also the host of the running agent software. Using [partial rotation](partial-rotation) to facilitate custodial key management the owner of the identifier retains [rotational authority](rotation-authority) and thus the ability to "fire" the custodian at any time without requiring the cooperation of the custodian.

## Importance
Custodial Agents are important for individuals who may not be comfortable managing their own [signing keys](digital-signature) and agent software but still want to participate in a decentralized identity ecosystem and they enable a software as a service business model without centralizing control on the service provider.

## Key functionality
Since ninety-nine percent of people in the world might not feel comfortable taking responsibility for their own practical [key management](key-management) but still want to be stay in control over their assets and be able to hire and fire service providers, this functionality is considered a key feature for KERI and ACDC.
