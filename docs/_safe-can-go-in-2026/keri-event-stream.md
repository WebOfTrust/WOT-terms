# keri event stream
## Definition
A stream of verifiable KERI data, consisting of the [key event log](key-event-log) and other data such as a [transaction event log](transaction-event-log). This data is a CESR event stream (TODO: link to IANA application/cesr media type) and may be serialized in a file using [CESR](composable-event-streaming-representation) encoding. We refer to these _CESR stream resources_ as KERI event streams to simplify the vocabulary.
