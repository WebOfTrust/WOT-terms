# decentralized identifier
## Definition
Decentralized identifiers (DID) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A _DID_ refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the DID.

## Relation to federated identifiers
In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, _DIDs_ have been designed so that they may be **decoupled from centralized registries**, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the discovery of information related to a DID, the design enables the controller of a DID to prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party.

## Technical presence
_DIDs_ are _URIs_ that associate a _DID subject_ with a _DID document_ allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.
