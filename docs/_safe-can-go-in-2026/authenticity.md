The three properties, authenticity, confidentiality, and privacy inhabit a trade space. ...
One can have any two of the three (privacy, authenticity, confidentiality) at the highest level but not all three.  
The trilemma insists that one must make a trade-off by prioritizing one or two properties over a third.

The ToIP [design goals](https://github.com/trustoverip/TechArch/blob/main/spec.md#61-design-goals) reflect that trade-off and provide an order of importance. The design goals indicate that one should start with high authenticity, then high confidentiality, and then as high as possible privacy, given there is no trade-off with respect to the other two.
