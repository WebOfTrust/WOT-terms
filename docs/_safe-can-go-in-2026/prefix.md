# prefix
## Definition

A prefix that is composed of a basic Base-64 (URL safe) derivation code pre-pended to Base-64 encoding of a basic public digital signing key.  
Including the derivation code in the prefix binds the derivation process along with the public key to the resultant identifier. 

>An example of the prefix with a one character derivation code and a 32 byte public key encoded into a 44 character Based-64 string follows:
