# application programming interface
## Definition
An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more [computer programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) to communicate with each other. It is a type of software [interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)), offering a service to other pieces of [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software). 

## API specification
A document or standard that describes how to build or use such a connection or interface is called an API specification. A computer system that meets this standard is said to implement or expose an API. The term [API](API) may refer either to the specification or to the implementation.
