# weight of weights
## Definition
There are 2 levels in the multi-sign weighted thresholds of [multi-signatures](multisig) in [KERI](KERI) because the solution only needs to focus on _tightly cooperating teams_.
- An individual using split keys over devices
- A team of teams

All other use cases can be solved by other means in KERI (e.g. [delegation](delegation)).

## CESR related
It also gives the advantage that the resulting [CESR](CESR) is more straightforward. It's hard to implement a recursive weight - of weights in CESR. And because of the alleged lack of use cases, KERI don't need to go beyond two levels.
