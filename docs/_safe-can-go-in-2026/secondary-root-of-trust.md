# secondary root of trust
## Definition

In KERI its a [root-of-trust](root-of-trust) that, for its secure attribution, depends on another verifiable data structure (VDS) which MUST be a [primary root-of-trust](primary-root-of-trust).  
By its nature and cryptographic anchoring via [seals](seal) to a primary root-of-trust, a secondary root-of-trust still has a high level of trustability and can be automatically verified.
