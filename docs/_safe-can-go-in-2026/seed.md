# seed
## Definition
In cryptography a 'seed' is a _pseudorandomly_ generated number, often expressed in representation of a series of words.  
Paraphrased from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_seed)

## Example 24-word seed

```

## Pseudorandom is not exactly random
Although sequences that are closer to truly random can be generated using [hardware random number generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator), pseudorandom number generators are important in practice for their speed in number generation and their reproducibility.
