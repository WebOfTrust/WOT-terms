# internal inconsistency
## Definition
Internal is used to describe things that exist or happen inside an [entity](entity). In our scope of digital [identifiers](identifier) its (in)consistency is considered within the defining data structures and related data stores.

In [KERI](key-event-receipt-infrastructure) we are protected against internal inconsistency by the hash chain datastructure of the [KEL](key-event-log), because the only [authority](authority) that can sign the log is the [controller](controller) itself.
