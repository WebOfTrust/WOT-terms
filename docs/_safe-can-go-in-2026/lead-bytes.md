# lead bytes
## Definition
In order to avoid confusion with the use of the term [pad](pad) character, when [pre-pad](pre-pad)ding with bytes that are not replaced later, we use the term **lead bytes**. So lead-bytes are added "pre-conversion".

The term [pad](pad) may be confusing not merely because both ways use a type of padding but it is also true that the number of pad characters when padding _post-conversion_ equals the number of lead bytes when padding _pre-conversion_.
