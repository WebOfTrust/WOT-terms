## Definition
Is the minimum number of valid signatures to satisfy the requirement for successful verification in a [Threshold Signature Scheme](threshold-signature-scheme.md).

## Example 2-of-3 signature
In a 2-of-3 signature scheme the threshold is 2. This means that 2 valid signatures are enough to fulfil the required signature.
