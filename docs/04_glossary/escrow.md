## Definition

'Escrow' **as a noun** is a (legal) arrangement in which a third party temporarily holds money or property until a particular condition has been met.

'Escrow' **as a verb**: we use it in protocol design to handle out of order events.  Store the event and wait for the other stuff to show up and then continue processing of the event. So _escrowing_ is the process of storing this event. We root back to the event later.
