## More detail
In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), a clone is [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware) or [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) that is designed to function in exactly the same way as another system.

A specific subset of clones are remakes (or remades), which are revivals of old, obsolete, or discontinued products.
