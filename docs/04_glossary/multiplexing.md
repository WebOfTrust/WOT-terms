# multiplexing
## Definition

In [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications) and [computer networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network), multiplexing (sometimes contracted to _muxing_) is a method by which multiple analog or digital signals are combined into one signal over a [shared medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_medium). The aim is to share a scarce resource - a physical [transmission medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium).

Because of [count codes](count-code) and the [composability](composability) - and [concatenation](concatenation) property in CESR, [pipelining](pipelining) is possible, which then uses _multiplexing_ (combining [self-framing](self-framing) primitives) and _de-multiplexing_ (unravelling self-framing [primitives](primitive)). The addition of group framing codes as independently composable primitives enables [hierarchical compositions](hierarchical-composition).
