# extensible business reporting language
## Definition

XBRL is the open international standard for digital business reporting, managed by a global not for profit consortium, XBRL International. 

## Practical
XBRL provides a language in which reporting terms can be authoritatively defined. Those terms can then be used to uniquely represent the contents of financial statements or other kinds of compliance, performance and business reports. XBRL lets reporting information move between organisations rapidly, accurately and digitally.
