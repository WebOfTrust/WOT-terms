# credential
## Definition

Evidence of authority, status, rights, entitlement to privileges, or the like.  
([source](https://github.com/trustoverip/tswg-acdc-specification/blob/main/draft-ssmith-acdc.md#introduction))   
A credential has its current state and a history, which is captured in a doc or a graph.

## ACDC specific
The credential is the whole graph.  
The pointers in the doc that contain the whole graph are universally globally distributable references via the SAIDs. Whereas in other credential systems pointers are only local in a credential doc.
