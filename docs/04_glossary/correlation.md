# correlation
## Definition
In our scope this is an identifier used to indicate that external parties have observed how wallet contents are related. 

## Example 
When a public key is reused, it conveys that some common entity is controlling both identifiers. Tracking correlation allows for software to warn when some new information might be about to be exposed, for example: "Looks like you are about to send cryptocurrency, from an account you frequently use to a new account you just created."
