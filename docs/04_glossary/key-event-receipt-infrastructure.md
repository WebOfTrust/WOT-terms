# key event receipt infrastructure
## Definition

Also `KERI`. It's a new approach to decentralized identifiers and decentralized key management that promises significant benefits for `SSI` (self-sovereign identity) and `ToIP` (Trust over IP) infrastructure.

KERI is an identifier system that fixes the internet. It's a fully decentralized permission-less key management architecture. It solves the `secure attribution problem` to its identifiers and allows portability.

## Trust spanning layer for the internet

While attribution has always been a non-exact science, we could come as close to attribution as “beyond a reasonable doubt”, those days are over with KERI.  
KERI provides a trust spanning layer for the internet, because **the protocol solves the secure attribution problem** in a general, portable, fully decentralized way. There are more types of trust IN KERI but they all depend on the most important _attributive_ trust.
From KERI we've learned that _secure attribution_ is the essential problem for _any_ `identifier system` to solve.
