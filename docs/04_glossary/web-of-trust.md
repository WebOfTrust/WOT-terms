# web of trust
## Definition

In cryptography, a web of trust is a concept used in [PGP](PGP), [GnuPG](gnu-privacy-guard), and other `OpenPGP`-compatible systems to establish the authenticity of the binding between a public key and its owner.  
Its _decentralized_ trust model is an alternative to the centralized trust model of a public key infrastructure (`PKI`), which relies exclusively on a certificate authority (or a hierarchy of such). As with computer networks, there are many independent webs of trust, and any user (through their identity certificate) can be a part of, and a link between, multiple webs. The web of trust concept was first put forth by PGP creator Phil Zimmermann in 1992 in the manual for PGP.
