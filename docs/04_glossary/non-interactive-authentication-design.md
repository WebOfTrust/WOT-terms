## Definition
A group of approaches having non-interactive mechanisms that pose unique problems because they do not allow a challenge response reply handshake. A request is submitted that is self-authenticating without additional interaction. The main benefits of non-interactive authentication are scalability and path independent end-to-end verifiability. These benefits become more important in decentralized applications that employ [zero-trust](zero-trust) architectures.
