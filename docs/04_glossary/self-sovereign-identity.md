## Definition
Self-sovereign identity is a decentralized identity architecture that implements the Principles of SSI â€” principally that it puts the identity controller (e.g., a natural person or organization) directly in control of the identifiers and credentials they use to assert their digital identity.

## History

The definition started in the blog "[The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html)" by Christopher Allen in 2016. has not resulted in a consensus today. While some see the ten principles of SSI that Allen proposed as the definition of SSI, he formulated them as "a departure point to provoke a discussion about what's truly important". And it is obvious that what is important differs per [party](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/terms/party).
