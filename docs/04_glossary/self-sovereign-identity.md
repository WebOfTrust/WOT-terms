## Definition
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a term that has many different interpretations, and that we use to refer to concepts/ideas, architectures, processes and technologies that aim to support (autonomous) parties as they negotiate and execute electronic transactions with one another.  
Paraphrased by @henkvancann, sources [eSSIF-lab](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/terms/self-sovereign-identity) and [ToIP](https://github.com/trustoverip/toip/wiki/self-sovereign-identity).

The definition started in the blog "[The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html)" by Christopher Allen in 2016. has not resulted in a consensus today. While some see the ten principles of SSI that Allen proposed as the definition of SSI, he formulated them as "a departure point to provoke a discussion about what's truly important". And it is obvious that what is important differs per [party](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/terms/party).
