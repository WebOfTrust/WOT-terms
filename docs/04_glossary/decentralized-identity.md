# decentralized identity
## Definition 
is a technology that uses cryptography to allow individuals to create and control their own unique identifiers. They can use these identifiers to obtain `Verifiable Credentials` from trusted organizations and, subsequently, present elements of these credentials as proof of claims about themselves. In this model, the individual takes ownership of their own identity and need not cede control to centralized service providers or companies.

`KERI`s definition of decentralization (centralization) is about _control_ not _spatial distribution_. In our definition _decentralized_ is not necessarily the same as _distributed_. By distributed we mean that activity happens at more than one site. Thus decentralization is about _control_ and distribution is about _place_. To elaborate, when we refer to decentralized infrastructure we mean infrastructure under decentralized (centralized) control no matter its spatial distribution. Thus _decentralized infrastructure_ is infrastructure sourced or controlled by more than one `entity`.
