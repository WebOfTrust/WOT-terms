# composable event streaming representation
## Definition

Also called 'CESR'. This compact encoding scheme fully supports both textual and binary streaming applications of attached crypto material of all types. This approach includes [composability](composability) in both the textual and binary streaming domains. The primitives may be the minimum possible but still composable size. 

Making composability a guaranteed property allows future extensible support of new compositions of streaming formats based on pre-existing core primitives and compositions of core primitives. This enables optimized stream processing in both the binary and text domains.
