## Definition
Verifiable by anyone, anywhere, at anytime. Although this seems a general term, it was first used in the context of KERI by Sam Smith.

_Ambient Duplicity Detection_ is an example of ambient verifiability that describes the possibility of detecting duplicity by anyone, anywhere, anytime.

### Criteria
As soon as you limit any of the parameters of location, time or who can verify, it's not 'ambient verifiability' anymore.
For a signature to be ambiently verifiable, it needs to have no restrictions on these parameters.
