# ambient verifiability
## Definition
Verifiable by anyone, anywhere, at anytime. Although this seems a pretty general term, it was first used in the context of KERI by Sam Smith.

An example of ambient verifiability is _Ambient Duplicity Detection_ that describes the possibility of detecting duplicity by anyone, anywhere, anytime.
