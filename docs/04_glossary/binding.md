# binding
## Definition
In short, the technique of connecting two data elements together. In the context of [KERI](key-event-receipt-infrastructure) it's the association of data or an [identifier](identifier) with another identifier or a subject (a person, organization or machine), thereby lifting the privacy of the subject through that connection, i.e. **binding**.
