# privacy washing
## Definition
De-identification so that it provides a personal data safe harbour and could be legally acceptable forwarded.

## Possible solution
We might need legally enforced pressure for it to be no longer acceptable that you've _un-seen_ the (re-identifiable) personal data.  
"Once you see, you can't un-see".
