### 1. Leverage cooperative network effects
How to remove primary barriers to cooperation? Different value contexts implies 'not directly competitive'. So we need to find value that is transferrable between contexts. Therefore: Use trans-contextual value creation and capture to fuel cooperative network effects.

### 2. Retake control of our data
KERI assists in this.
