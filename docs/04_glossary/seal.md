## Definition
A cryptographic commitment in the form of a cryptographic digest or hash tree root (Merkle root) that anchors arbitrary data or a tree of hashes of arbitrary data to a particular event in the key event sequence.

A seal is a cryptographic proof in a secondary root-of-trust (e.g. TEL) that is anchored in a primary-root-of-trust (e.g.KEL).
