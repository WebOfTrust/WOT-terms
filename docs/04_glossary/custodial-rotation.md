## Definition
Rotation is based on control authority that is split between two key sets. The first for signing authority and the second (pre-rotated) for rotation authority, the associated thresholds and key list can be structured so that a designated custodial agent can hold signing authority, while the original controller can hold exclusive rotation authority.  
[Partial pre-rotation](partial-rotation) supports the vital use case of custodial key rotation to authorize a [custodial agent](custodial-agent).
