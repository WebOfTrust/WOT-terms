## Definition 
Cryptography libraries deal with cryptography algorithms and have API function calls to each of the supported features. 

## Selection criteria
Criteria to chose one or the other:
- Open Source (most of them are)
- Compliant with standards
- Key operations include key generation algorithms, key exchange agreements and public key cryptography standards.
- Supported cryptographic hash functions
- Implementations of message authentication code (MAC) algorithms
- Implementations of block ciphers
- Hardware-assisted support
- Code size and code to comment ratio
- Composable derivation codes
