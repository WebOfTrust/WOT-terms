## Definition
a namespace that is self-certifying and hence self-administrating. An AN has a self-certifying prefix that provides cryptographic verification of root control authority over its namespace. All derived AIDs in the same AN share the same root-of-trust, source-of-truth, and locus-of-control (RSL). The governance of the namespace is, therefore, unified into one entity, that is, the controller who is/holds the root authority over the namespace.

Namespaces are, therefore, portable and truly self-sovereign.
