## Definition
Either a [most compact](most-compact.md) version of an ACDC or the [fully compact](fully-compact) version of an ACDC. An [Issuer](issuer.md) commitment via a signature to any variant of ACDC (compact, full, etc) makes a cryptographic commitment to the top-level section fields shared by all variants of that ACDC because the value of a [top level section field](top-level-section) is either the [SAD](SAD.md) or the [SAID](SAID) of the SAD of the associated section.

## Relation
All the variants of an [ACDC](authentic-chained-data-container) are various degrees of expansion of the compact variant.\
