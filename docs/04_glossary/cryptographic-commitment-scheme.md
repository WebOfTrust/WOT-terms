# cryptographic commitment scheme
## Definition
is a cryptographic primitive that allows one to commit to a chosen value (or chosen statement) while keeping it hidden to others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later. 

Commitment schemes are designed so that a party cannot change the value or statement after they have committed to it: that is, commitment schemes are _binding_.
