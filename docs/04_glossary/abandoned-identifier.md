## Definition
An [AID](AID) is abandoned when either the [Inception](inception-event) or a subsequent [Rotation event](rotation-event) rotates to an empty next key digest list (which means the next threshold must also be 0).

## More
When an AID is abandoned, `ndigers` is zero (empty next key digest list ), so any event after the event that made it nontransferable is not accepted.
