# cryptographic primitive
## Definition
Cryptographic primitives are well-established, low-level [cryptographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) algorithms that are frequently used to build [cryptographic protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol) for [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security) systems. These routines include, but are not limited to, [one-way hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_hash_function) and [encryption functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher).

## KERI related
In KERI and ACDC it a serialization of a unitary value associated with a cryptographic operation including but not limited to a digest (hash), a salt, a seed, a private key, a public key, or a signature. All primitives in KERI MUST be expressed in [CESR](composable-event-streaming-representation).
