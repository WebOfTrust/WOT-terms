# sniffable
## Definition
A stream is _sniffable_ as soon as it starts with a group code or field map; in fact this is how our parser ([Parside](parside)) works. and detects if the CESR stream contains a certain datablock. 
The datablock of CESR binary, CESR Text, JSON, CBOR, MGPK have an Object code or the Group code (binary or text) and it's always a recognizable and unique _three bit combination_.

## Challenge
We have the Cold start problem of a stream: you don't where to start recognizing structured data.

## Criterium
So a stream is either sniffable or not, when it has or has not the fore-mentioned group- or object-codes.
