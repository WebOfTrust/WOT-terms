## Definition
Is a valid credential within in a 90 days grace period (the revocation transaction time frame before it's booked to revocation registry). {TBW prio 3}

## Design
When a relationship needs to be terminated with a [QVI](QVI) and the QVI has not revoked their credentials (yet) then those credentials become ghost credentials.
