## Explanation
In [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography), a salt is [random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Number_Generator) data that is used as an additional input to a [one-way function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function) that [hashes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)), a [password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password) or [passphrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase). 

### Usage
Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. Historically, only a cryptographic hash function of the password was stored on a system, but over time, additional safeguards were developed to protect against duplicate or common passwords being identifiable (as their hashes are identical).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)#cite_note-2) Salting is one such protection.
