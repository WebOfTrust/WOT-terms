# key stretching
## Definition

In [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography), key stretching techniques are used to make a possibly weak [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)), typically a [password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password) or [passphrase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase), more secure against a [brute-force attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack) by increasing the resources (time and possibly space) it takes to test each possible key. 

## Humans are predictable
Passwords or passphrases created by humans are often short or predictable enough to allow [password cracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking), and key stretching is intended to make such attacks more difficult by complicating a basic step of trying a single password candidate. Key stretching also improves security in some real-world applications where the key length has been constrained, by mimicking a longer key length from the perspective of a brute-force attacker.
