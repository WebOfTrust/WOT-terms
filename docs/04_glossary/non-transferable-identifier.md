# non transferable identifier
## Definition
Controlling keys over this identifier cannot be rotated and therefore this identifier is [non-transferable](non-transferable) to other control.  
An identifier of this type has specific positive features like short-lived, peer to peer, one-time use, discardable, etc. that are very practical in certain use cases. Moreover non-transferable identifiers are much easier to govern than persistent identifiers that are [transferable](transferable).

## KERI related

The KERI design approach is to build composable primitives instead of custom functionality that is so typical of other DKMI approaches:

- [transferable identifiers](transferable-identifier)
- non-transferable identifiers
- [delegated identifiers](delegated-identifier)
