# RUN
## Definition
The acronym for the new peer-to-peer end-verifiable monotonic update policy is RUN (**Read, Update, Nullify**). 

RUN as opposed to [CRUD](CRUD) which is the traditional client-server database update policy.

## OOBI related
We [RUN off the CRUD](run-off-the-crud), which means that because the source of truth for each data item is a decentralized controller Peer, a given database hosted by any Peer does not create records in the traditional sense of a server creating records for a client.
