## Definition
an identity system that includes a primary root-of-trust in self-certifying identifiers that are strongly bound at issuance to a cryptographic signing (public, private) key pair. An AIS enables any entity to establish control over an AN in an independent, interoperable, and portable way.

## Explanation
There's nobody that can intervene with the establishment of the authenticity of a control operation because you can verify all the way back to the root-of-trust.
