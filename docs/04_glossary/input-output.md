# input output
## Definition
In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), input/output (I/O, or informally io or IO) is the communication between an information processing system, such as a [computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer), and the outside world, possibly a human or another information processing system. [Inputs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information) are the signals or [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing)) received by the system and outputs are the signals or data sent from it. The term can also be used as part of an action; to "perform I/O" is to perform an [input or output operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I/O_scheduling).
