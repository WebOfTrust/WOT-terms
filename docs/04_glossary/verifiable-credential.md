# verifiable credential
## Definition
Verifiable credentials (VCs) are an [open standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard) for digital credentials. They can represent information found in physical credentials, such as a passport or license, as well as new things that have no physical equivalent, such as ownership of a bank account.
