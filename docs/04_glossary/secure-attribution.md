# secure attribution
## Definition

In short: secure attribution is "whodunit?!" in cyberspace.

Secure attribution is strongly related to _making and proving statements_. A [controller](controller) makes statements to the a [validator](validator) or verifier, who in turn validates the statements issued. A [controller](controller) "_owns_" the statement: content and attribution via digital signatures.  
_Secure attribution of a statement_ is a way of proving that **the statement is an authentic statement of the `controller`**. 

## Relationship with KERI
In the context of KERI and ACDC _secure_ means a **`Validator` may cryptographically verify** the statement.
