# blinded revocation registry
## Definition
The current state of a [transaction event log](transaction-event-log) (TEL) **may be hidden or blinded** such that _the only way_ for a potential verifier of the state to observe that state is _when the controller of a designated AID discloses it_ at the time of presentation.

The issuer creates and signs the bulk issuance set of credentials and shares a salt with the presenters.
The shared salt correlates between the issuer and the issuee, but that is the worst problem we have to consider, which is acceptable.

## Important observation
The presenter does the decomposition in a way that allows a verifier to conclude: "Yes that was an approved schema issued by the issuer!"
