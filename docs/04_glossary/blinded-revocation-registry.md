The issuer creates and signs the bulk issuance set of credentials and shares a salt with the presenters.
The shared salt correlates between the issuer and the issuee, but that is the worst problem we have to consider, which is acceptable.

## Important observation
The presenter does the decomposition in a way that allows a verifier to conclude: "Yes that was an approved schema issued by the issuer!"
