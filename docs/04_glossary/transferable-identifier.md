## Definition
Control over the identifier [can be transferred](transferable) by [rotating keys](rotation).  
A synonym is 'persistent identifier'.

## KERI related

The KERI design approach is to build composable primitives instead of custom functionality that is so typical of other DKMI approaches:

- transferable identifiers
- [non-transferable identifiers](non-transferable-identifier)
- [delegated identifiers](delegated-identifier)
