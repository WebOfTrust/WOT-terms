# coroutines
## Definition
Computer programs that can be suspended and resumed at will.

## What is a coroutine exactly?
Coroutines are [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) components that generalize [subroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subroutine) for [non-preemptive multitasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-preemptive_multitasking), by allowing execution to be suspended and resumed. Coroutines are well-suited for implementing familiar program components such as [cooperative tasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_multitasking), [exceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling), [event loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_loop), [iterators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator), [infinite lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) and [pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(software)).
