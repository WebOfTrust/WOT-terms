# most compact
## Definition
An [ACDC](ACDC) that, for a given level of disclosure, is as compact as it can be which means
- it has the [SAID](SAID)s for each section that are not disclosed 
- it has expanded sections that are disclosed 

Multiple forms of a single ACDC can be called the "most compact" version given that each level of graduated disclosure will have a "most compacted" version. If all the blocks are expanded of a most compact version then it becomes fully expanded. If all the blocks are replaced with SAIDs then it becomes fully compacted. 

This form is a part of the graduated disclosure objective.
