## KERI and ACDC context
Source of a particular piece of information from one place, considered to present the truth. However both KERI and ACDC only commit to the secure attribution of _who_ said something and not whether _what_ has been said is true or not. Veracity is an individual (organisational) conclusion that needs governance and virtual credentials. KERI and ACDC support veracity (concluding it's the "the truth") but doesn't solve it.
