# pseudo random number
## Definition
A (set of) value(s) or element(s) that is statistically random, but it is derived from a known starting point and is typically repeated over and over. Pseudo-random numbers provide necessary values for processes that require randomness, such as creating test signals or for synchronizing sending and receiving devices in a spread spectrum transmission. 

It is called "pseudo" random, **because the algorithm can repeat the sequence**, and the numbers are thus not entirely random.
