# levels of assurance
## Definition 
Identity and other trust decisions are often not binary. They are judgement calls. Any time that judgement is not a simple “Yes/No” answer, you have the option for levels of assurance. Also 'LoA'.

### Relation with KERI
KERI has the same LOAs for entropy and trust in human behavior preserving the security of key pairs and preserving their own privacy. It has high LOAs for the cryptographic bindings of controllers and identifiers. Also the validation of witnesses and watchtowers has high a LOA.
