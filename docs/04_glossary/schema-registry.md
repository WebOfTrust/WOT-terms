## Definition
Central [registry](registry) for credential schemas based on namespaces. 

## ACDC related
ACDCs and SAIDS **eliminated the need** for a centrally controlled namespace registry for credential schemas.

From our vocabulary that contains the term "[Public verifiable credential registry](public-verifiable-credential-registry)" there's follow-up on ToIP definitions like | TBW |

## Comparison and explanation
[Syntio](https://www.syntio.net/en/labs-musings/schema-registry-comparison/) comparison of (old-school?) centralized schema registries.

This source has conceptual explanations in diagrams like the one below and code examples. However, **be aware that ACDC solves this in a different way** with [KERI-based verifiable data structures](VDS) and [graph fragments](graph-fragment).
