# KAPI
## Definition
Application programmer interfaces (APIs) for the various components in the KERI ecosystem such as Controllers, Agents, Witnesses, Watchers, Registrars etc need by which they can share information. The unique properties of the KERI protocol require APIs that preserve those properties. We call the set of APIs the KERI API.
