# keri improvement doc
## Definition
These docs are modular so teams of contributors can independently work and create PRs of individual KIDs; KIDs answer the question "how we do it". We add commentary to the indivudual KIDs that elaborate on the why. It has been split from the how to not bother implementors with the why.
