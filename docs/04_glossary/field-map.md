# field map
## Definition
A traditional `key:value` pair renamed to avoid confusing with the cryptographic use of the term 'key'.

To avoid confusion with the cryptographic use of the term key we instead use the term field to refer to a mapping pair and the terms _field label_ and _field value_ for each member of a pair. These pairs can be represented by two tuples e.g (`label, value`). We qualify this terminology when necessary by using the term _field map_ to reference such a mapping.

## Nested field maps
Field maps may be nested where a given field value is itself a reference to another field map. We call this nested set of fields a nested field map or simply a nested map for short.
