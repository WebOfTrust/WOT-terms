# designated aliases
## Definition

An AID controller can designate aliases which are AID controlled identifiers such as a did:keri, did:webs, etc. The [AID](AID) controller issues a designated aliases attestation (no issuee) that lists the identifiers and manages the status through a registry anchored to their KEL. See the [designated aliases docs](https://weboftrust.github.io/schema/desig-aliases)
