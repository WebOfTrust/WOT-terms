# interoperability
## Definition
Interoperability is a characteristic of a product or system to work with other products or systems. While the term was initially defined for [information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology) or [systems engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering) services to allow for information exchange.

## Types relevant for KERI and ACDC
[Identifier interoperability](https://www.doi.org/factsheets/Identifier_Interoper.html) enables users to re-use these identifiers (and their associated data) across different applications. Such interoperability of identifiers encompasses not only technical aspects of interoperability but consideration of the purpose and community of use of the identifiers.

If two or more systems use common [data formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format) and [communication protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol) and are capable of communicating with each other, they exhibit syntactic interoperability. [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) are examples of common data formats and protocols. Lower-level data formats also contribute to syntactic interoperability, ensuring that alphabetical characters are stored in the same [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) or a [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) format in all the communicating systems.

Beyond the ability of two or more computer systems to exchange information, [semantic interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_interoperability) is the ability to automatically interpret the information exchanged meaningfully and accurately in order to produce useful results as defined by the end users of both systems.

[Cross-domain interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-domain_interoperability) involves multiple social, organizational, political, legal entities working together for a common interest or information exchange.
