## Definition
Append-only is a property of computer data storage such that new data can be appended to the storage, but where existing data is immutable.

A blockchain is an example of an append-only log. The events can be transactions. Bitcoin is a well-known Append only log where the events are [totally ordered](https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/_new#total-ordering) and signed transfers of control over unspent transaction output.
