## Definition
In cryptography and identity _collision_ generally refers to something going wrong because an identical result has been produced but it refers to - or points to - different sources or assets backing this result.

E.g. two hashes collide, meaning two different digital sources produce the same hash.\
Another example is [name(space) collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_collision).

## Naming collision
A circumstance where two or more identifiers in a given [namespace](namespace.md) or a given scope cannot be unambiguously resolved.\
