# text binary concatenation composability
## Definition

An encoding has _composability_ when any set of [self-framing](self-framing) concatenated primitives expressed in either the text domain or binary domain may be converted as a group to the other domain and back again without loss.

## CESR related
CESR is fully text binary concatenation composable.

## Example in analogy
Use Google Translate to translate a piece of text from English to Dutch. Subsequently, keep copy pasting the resulting “to:” text into the “from:” field. The message changes until it comes to a standstill where you can keep swapping the texts without them changing.

The conclusion is: Google Translate is not composable!

By contrast, CESR is composable. The _analogy_ lies in the fact that we consider two languages. Suppose the English in the Google Translate example is _readable, text based_ in CESR and Dutch is the _binary_ form in CESR. Within these two CESR “languages”, text-based and binary, you can concatenate and swap freely as many times as you like — the data won’t change in between in their binary or text form no matter what content you express with them.
