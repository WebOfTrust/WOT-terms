## Definition

a key management infrastructure that does not rely on a single entity for the integrity and security of the system as a whole. Trust in a DKMI is decentralized through the use of technologies that make it possible for geographically and politically disparate entities to reach an agreement on the key state of an identifier [DPKI](https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/#term:dpki).
