# registration interaction
## Definition
Setup/Registration interaction, new AID and authorization to establish access control. You present a ([vLEI](vLEI)) credential. You don't want that captured and misused. Narrowing the scope to a certain role (e.g. Document Submitter) is a pre-registration via [delegatable](delegation) authority.

The [Credential](verifiable-credential) is like a bearer token. Does it matter if the credential was delivered by the [issuee](issuee)? The token is [proof of the authorization](proof-of-authority), but does the delivery require the issuee signature? Depends on the context. If it is an idempotent process resubmission has no effect.
