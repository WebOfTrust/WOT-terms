## Definition
Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.

The domain of privacy partially overlaps with [security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security), which can include the concepts of appropriate use and protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of [bodily integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodily_integrity).

The three properties, authenticity, confidentiality, and privacy inhabit a trade space. ...
One can have any two of the three (privacy, authenticity, confidentiality) at the highest level but not all three.  
The trilemma insists that one must make a trade-off by prioritizing one or two properties over a third.

The ToIP [design goals](https://github.com/trustoverip/TechArch/blob/main/spec.md#61-design-goals) reflect that trade-off and provide an order of importance. The design goals indicate that one should start with high authenticity, then high confidentiality, and then as high as possible privacy, given there is no trade-off with respect to the other two.
