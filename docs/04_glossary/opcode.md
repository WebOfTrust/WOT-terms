# opcode
## Definition
Opcodes are meant to provide stream processing instructions that are more general and flexible than simply concatenated primitives or groups of primitives. 

## Why opcodes
A yet to be determined stack based virtual machine could be executed using a set of opcodes that provides primitive, primitive group, or stream processing instructions. This would enable highly customizable uses for [CESR](composable-event-streaming-representation).

### Opcode tables
The ‘_’ selector is reserved for the yet to be defined [opcode](opcode) table or tables.
