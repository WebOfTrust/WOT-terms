# key event
## Definition
Concretely, the serialized data structure of an entry in the key event log for an AID. Abstractly, the data structure itself. Key events come in different types and are used primarily to establish or change the authoritative set of keypairs and/or anchor other data to the authoritative set of keypairs at the point in the key event log actualized by a particular entry.
