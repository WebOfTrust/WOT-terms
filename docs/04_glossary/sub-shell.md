## Parent - and child process
A child process in computing is a [process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing)) created by another process (the [parent process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parent_process)). This technique pertains to [multitasking operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking), and is sometimes called a subprocess or traditionally a subtask.
