# security cost performance architecture trade off
## Definition
The degree of protection offered by a key management infrastructure usually forces a trade-off between security, cost, and performance.  
Typically, key generation happens relatively infrequently compared to event signing. But highly secure key generation may not support highly performant signing. This creates an architecture trade-off problem.
