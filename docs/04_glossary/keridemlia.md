## Definition

It is a contraction of [KERI](key-event-receipt-infratructure) and [Kademlia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia). It's the distributed database of Witness IP-addresses based on a [Distributed Hash Table](distributed-hash-table). It also does the CNAME - stuff that [DNS](DNS) offers for KERI: the mapping between an identifier and it's controller AID stored in the KEL to its current wittness AID and the wittness AID to the IP address.
