## Definition
Verifiable credentials are issued by authorized validation agents ([QVIs](QVI)) under the governance of [GLEIF](GLEIF), who delegate tasks to these agents. They provide cryptographic proof that the information about a legal entity, as linked to its Legal Entity Identifier (LEI), is verifiably authentic, accurate, and up-to-date.


### Explanation
The v in vLEI stands for “verifiable”, but what does that mean? In this case, "verifiable" comes from “Verifiable Credential”. A verifiable credential is just a collection of information with a mechanism that allows a computer to verify that the information has not been modified and that the information was originally stated to be correct by some third party (maybe a bank or the driving license authority). Often (almost always really), the information will include a link to the entity the information is about.
