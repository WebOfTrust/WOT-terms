## Definition
Refers to the state of cryptographic verifiability across a network or system. It generally implies that a particular identifier, event, or data set is consistent, fully verified, and cannot be contested within KERI.

## Examples

#### Stable Identifier
An identifier is considered stable when its associated event sequence (establishment, rotations, etc.) has been published by sufficient witnesses so that it can be verified and acknowledged by a quorum of watchers.

#### Stable State
After a key rotation event, the new keys are considered stable only when enough receipts from witnesses confirm the event.
