## Definition

An identifier that is [self-certifying](self-certifying-identifier) and [self-sovereign](self-sovereign-identity).

## KERI related requirements

A self-managing [cryptonym](cryptonymous)ous identifier that MUST be self-certifying (self-authenticating) and MUST be encoded in CESR as a [qualified](qualified) cryptographic primitive. An AID MAY exhibit other self-managing properties such as transferable control using key [pre-rotation](pre-rotation) which enables control over such an AID to persist in spite of key weakness or compromise due to exposure. [Authoritative](authoritative) control over the identifier persists in spite of the evolution of the key-state.\

## Autonomic Identifier more general

Autonomic Identifiers have been pretty well described in this piece as opposed to centralised (administrative) and blockchain-based (algorithmic) identifier systems: **Architectural types of Identity Systems**; originally by Phil Windley in this [article](https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml).

A summarizing comparison table might say more than a hundred words:
