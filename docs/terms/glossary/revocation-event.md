## Definition

Revocation is the act of [recall](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/recall) or [annulment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulment). It is the cancelling of an act, the recalling of a grant or privilege, or the making [void](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(law)) of some [deed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deed) previously existing.\
