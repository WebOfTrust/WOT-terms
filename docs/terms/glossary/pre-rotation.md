## Definition
commitment to next rotated key set in previous rotation or inception event.

### 
It is a new invention in KERI. Pre-rotation is a cryptographical commitment (a hash) to the next private key in the rotation-scheme.\
The pre-rotation scheme provides secure verifiable rotation that mitigates successful exploit of a given set of signing private keys from a set of (public, private) key-pairs when that exploit happens sometime after its creation and its first use to issue a self-certifying identifier. In other words, it assumes that the private keys remains private until after issuance of the associated identifier.
