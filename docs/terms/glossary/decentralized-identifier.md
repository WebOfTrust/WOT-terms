## Definition
[Decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) ([DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers)s) are a new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) refers to any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by the controller of the DID.\

## Relation to federated identifiers
In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, [DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) have been designed so that they may be **decoupled from centralized registries**, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the discovery of information related to a [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers), the design enables the controller of a [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) to prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party.\

## Technical presence
[DIDs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers) are [URIs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-uri) that associate a [DID subject](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-subjects) with a [DID document](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-documents) allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject.\
