## Definition

Opcodes are meant to provide stream processing instructions that are more general and flexible than simply concatenated primitives or groups of primitives.

## Why opcodes

A yet to be determined stack based virtual machine could be executed using a set of opcodes that provides primitive, primitive group, or stream processing instructions. This would enable highly customizable uses for [CESR](composable-event-streaming-representation.md).

### Opcode tables

The ‘\_’ selector is reserved for the yet to be defined [opcode](opcode.md) table or tables.
