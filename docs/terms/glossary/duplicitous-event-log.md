## Definition

This is a record of inconsistent event messages produced by a given controller or witness with respect to a given KERL. The duplicitous events are indexed to the corresponding event in a KERL. A duplicitous event is represented by a set of two or more provably mutually inconsistent event messages with respect to a KERL. Each juror keeps a duplicitous event log (DEL) for each controller and all designated witness with respect to a KERL. Any validator may confirm duplicity by examining a DEL.
