## Definition
disclosure performed by a presentation exchange that has cross-variant (see [compact variant](compact-variant)) Issuer commitment verifiability as an essential property. It supports graduated disclosure by the [Disclosee](disclosee) of any or all variants wether it be full, compact, metadata, partial, selective, bulk issued, or contractually protected.\

## Reuse
The [SAID](SAID) of a given variant is useful even when it is not the SAID of the variant the [Issuer](issuer) signed because during graduated disclosure the [Discloser](discloser) MAY choose to sign that given variant to fulfil a given step in an IPEX graduated disclosure transaction. 

## Rule
The disclosure performed by a presentation exchange MAY be [graduated](graduated-disclosure) and MAY be [contractually](contractually-protected-disclosure) protected.
