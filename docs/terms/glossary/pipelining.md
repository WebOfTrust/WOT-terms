## Definition
In [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing), a pipeline, also known as a data pipeline, is a set of [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data) processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one. The elements of a pipeline are often executed in parallel or in time-sliced fashion. Some amount of [buffer storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_(computer_science)) is often inserted between elements.\
