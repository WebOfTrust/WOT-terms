## Definition
determines current authoritative key set for identifier from the key event receipt logs from a set of witnesses. Judges transmit the 'judgement' of watchers concerning duplicity.

## Where judges run
Example AT&T vs T-Mobile. The only "fault" that is apparent, is an attack on the KEL. And that can only occur via key compromise. So a successful multi-threshold attack causing [duplicity](duplicity) is the only thing [watchers](watcher) are looking for. 

## Competitor and common interest
So even competitors will want to share across the entire ecosystem. Similar to certificate transparency, all competitors in the internet hosting space share the information with each other because it is in their best interest to eliminate fraud / duplicity.\
