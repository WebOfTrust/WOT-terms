The friendly spectacled bear from “darkest Peru” – with his old hat, battered suitcase, duffel coat and love of marmalade – has become a classic character in children's literature.[2] An anthropomorphised bear, Paddington is always polite – addressing people as “Mr”, “Mrs” and “Miss” but rarely by first names – and kindhearted, though he inflicts hard stares on those who incur his disapproval.[3] He has an endless capacity for innocently getting into trouble, but he is known to “try so hard to get things right”. He was discovered in London Paddington station by the (human) Brown family who adopted him and gives his full name as “Paddington Brown,” as his original name in bear language was too hard for them to pronounce.

One of the most beloved British fictional characters, a Paddington Bear soft toy was chosen by British tunnellers as the first item to pass through to their French counterparts when the two sides of the Channel Tunnel were linked in 1994.[4] Paddington books have been translated into 30 languages across 70 titles and have sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. As of June 2016, the Paddington Bear franchise was owned by Vivendi's StudioCanal. Bond, however, continued to own the publishing rights to his series, which was licensed to HarperCollins in April 2017.[5]
