They are going to have to invest some effort to either acquire that background or be patient enough to walk through lengthy tutorials.
There is no short cut.
KERI creator Sam Smith: &quot;There were a dozen people at IIW April 2021 that sat through three hours of the KERI security sessions where I patiently walked through it. But we only covered half a dozen of the meta security issues and could easily spend another three hours covering
several more and many more covering the micro security issues. But most will never take that much time.&quot;</p><p>Lots of experts in the Decentralized Identity field have extremely deep understanding of legacy IT tech but have a very shallow understanding of crypto, real key management, and distributed consensus. So they are not yet equipped well enough to design decentralized identity systems,
despite their 30+ years of working in the identity space. The future of distributed security is based on something called <code>zero trust computing</code> and many of these same experts in the Decentralized Identity field have a best a passing familiarity with what zero trust means.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="q-what-is-keris-most-important-critique-on-the-decentralized-identity-space">*<!-- -->*<!-- -->Q: What is KERI&#x27;s most important critique on the Decentralized Identity space?<a href="#q-what-is-keris-most-important-critique-on-the-decentralized-identity-space" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to q-what-is-keris-most-important-critique-on-the-decentralized-identity-space" title="Direct link to q-what-is-keris-most-important-critique-on-the-decentralized-identity-space">​</a></h2><p>Although the Decentralized Identity space is young, it&#x27;s already pretty biased and sometimes narrow minded.

The root-of-trust and the key state is at a lower level always in KERI. You don&#x27;t co-mingle those. Which is probably the biggest design flaw of most what we see in the Decentralized Identity community where they co-mingle control state and key state with transaction state with means they are locked together.</li><li>The number of DID methods seems to explode all with their own security characteristics, which makes interoperability a chain as strong as the weakest link.</li><li>The DID community has embraced (public) blockchains to get rid of the middle men. Apart from <strong>the question whether that could be a successful approach</strong> we see that for those experts it&#x27;s particularly hard to wrap their heads around the KERI security concept, which is scalable to VISA speed, doesn&#x27;t need a blockchain and can be used to re-design 95+% of all the DID methods by using KERI under the hood.

In every cryptographic system <strong>entropy</strong> rules, and if you don&#x27;t use a good <code>rng</code> (a <code>csprng</code>) you&#x27;re boned from the start. This is really important for everyone in the space to understand.</p><p>Generally you want to use the one supplied by the operating system. In linux this used to be <code>/dev/urandom</code>.
In Rust you typically use <code>OsRng</code> from the random crate in fashion. In <strong>cesride</strong> we rely on two variants due to the expectations of ed25519-dalek and k256, and we simply pass them to the libraries to generate keys.
You&#x27;d need to investigate how to get random bits in whatever language you are using, and just make sure what you are reading is about a <code>csprng</code> and not just an <code>rng</code> or <code>prng</code>.</p><p>This looks like it has a lot of good info: <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/11345/definition-of-a-csprng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/11345/definition-of-a-csprng</a></p><p>And, even a good <code>csprng</code> should be seeded well - if you can get random data from measuring user input or environmental conditions that can&#x27;t be easily controlled you will generally be more resistant to attack.</p><blockquote><p>Think about the case for example, where a designer is tempted to use a radio receiver and noise to seed the RNG, but an attacker floods the space with a frequency that produces a deterministic result in the ADC or something.</p></blockquote><p>(Source: Jason Colburne, Feb 2023)</p><p>In KERIpy we use libsodium through the python bindings. I&#x27;ve never actually looked at what their documentation says about <strong>randomness</strong>, but here it is:
The library provides a set of functions to generate unpredictable data, suitable for creating secret keys.</p><ul><li>On Windows systems, the <code>RtlGenRandom()</code> function is used.</li><li>On OpenBSD and Bitrig, the <code>arc4random()</code> function is used.</li><li>On recent FreeBSD and Linux kernels, the <code>getrandom</code> system call is used.</li><li>On other Unices, the <code>/dev/urandom</code> device is used.</li></ul><p>(Source: Philip Feairheller, Feb 2023)</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="q-what-is-the-main-component-of-keris-security">*<!-- -->Q: What is the main component of KERI&#x27;s security?<a href="#q-what-is-the-main-component-of-keris-security" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to q-what-is-the-main-component-of-keris-security" title="Direct link to q-what-is-the-main-component-of-keris-security">​</a></h2><p><strong>Key management</strong> is the main component, because every attack on KERI starts with <code>key compromise</code>. In KERI that is <a href="/WOT-terms/docs/glossary/key-compromise">strictly defined</a> and has a few caveats. There are no other attacks possible because KERI has consistent logs that are cryptographic verifiable to the <code>root-of-trust</code>, also know as the <code>public private key pair</code> used to create the identifier.\</p><p>So when we say “key compromise” in KERI we really mean compromise of <strong>one of these three things</strong>:
Three infrastructures that are included in “key management” systems that must be protected.</p><ol><li>Key pair creation and storage</li><li>Event signing</li><li>Event signature verification.</li></ol><p>The second two may be protected with threshold structures making them difficult to attack. KERI pre-rotation also protects event signing in the sense that a side channel attack on the signing keys is recoverable via the pre-rotation keys. Event signing is a form of key compromise. The third one event signature verification is the one someone is most likely to take issue with and so should be caveated. One can attack someone’s event signing infrastructure (code) and fool someone into believing that an invalid signature is a valid signature. But it is difficult to attack everyone’s event signature verification infrastructure in any general way so its not usually a very worthwhile attack. You are attacking the validator not the controller. So usually it is assumed that signature verification just works. So a really world class security expert would take exception with the additional statement “no other other attacks are possible” vs simply saying that all attacks must start with with key compromise. Usually stating that something is impossible is a bad idea. Everything is possible eventually.\

In KERI we have compact security for the sake of liveliness, which means there is no public ledger with total ordering of state. In KERI after duplicity is detected, you don&#x27;t trust that identifier anymore.

Afaik this ship sailed when KERI decided to define its own event format. I don&#x27;t think KERI shares any commonality with sidetree or did peer, and it&#x27;s no longer possible to align them, so while you can start with the same key material, doing similar operations will very quickly result in totally different event structures.</p><p>I don&#x27;t see a way for KERI events to be used by anything but KERI for now, certainly not Sidetree. In the future did:peer might use KERI events directly, but then did:peer would not be Sidetree compatible</p><p>...</p><p>The upside is that KERI could be much better than things built on JOSE. The down side is KERI won&#x27;t be possible to implement with off the shelf JOSE crypto. Having spent a lot of time with linked data, It looks like KERI is setup to feel all the same kind of pain, regarding reinventing the wheel instead of starting with compatibility with JOSE.</p><p>...</p><p>I predict a few years from now we will have:</p><ol><li>JOSE / JWS / JWK / jose based DIDs\</li><li><code>Multicodec</code> / IPFS / IPLD / DAG_CBOR / JWS / JWK / ipld based DIDs\</li><li>Linked Data / JSON-LD / CBOR-LD / linked data based DIDs\</li><li>KERI / KERI keys / KERI signatures / keri event log based DIDs</li></ol><p>There will be some overlap, for example KERI based DID Documents will likely support JWKs if they want to be useful with any legacy system, but internally KERI will use a different key representation. Similarly sidetree based DIDs will likely support linked data proofs but will only rely on JWS / JWK for internal operations.</p><p>As far as I know, the KERI design has specifically chosen not to build on JOSE, IPLD. or JSON-LD / CBOR-LD. So there won&#x27;t be any opportunity for interop with KERI below the DID Document layer. Which is true of many other systems, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Hyperledger based DIDs. Many of which don&#x27;t share event log interoperability.</p><p>Imo, if KERI used IPLD / JSON-LD / CBOR-LD, it would be better. Because not using them means reinventing the parts of them that are needed... which comes with the potential for better performance at the cost of inventing a faster wheel, and failing to pull developers / tooling from those established communities. However I can understand the desire to control the entire stack, and not use anyone else&#x27;s tooling.</p><p>From an engineering management and interoperability perspective, I would have decided to break compatibility after the whole system was built and working, and only in the areas where JWS / JWK or IPLD performance, documentation or library support was so bad it was justified.</p><p>...

Since delegated KELs were cross anchored, we loosened that to the same way non-delegated events do it: an <code>idempotent</code> authorization from one event log to the other. Delegated events have to go down this path too, whether they&#x27;re cross anchored or not. And the cross anchoring has a dead-lock risk, so we wanted to get rid of that. The advantage of not having performance risk on blocked processes on both event logs is huge. All the attacks that we (in a validator role, ed.) could think of, were still protected by duplicity detection. So using the same duplicity detection mechanism they use for non-delegated events, they&#x27;re still protected for delegated events when they&#x27;re trying to validate them (the latter, ed.). Since they have to do it for non-delegated events, the additional security of a cross anchor doesn&#x27;t change their code. The validators still have to going to do it the hard way for non-delegated events, so removing the extra security for a delegated event, didn&#x27;t do anything. Relaxing the original cross anchoring, doesn&#x27;t hurt us in any way.\
The only thing I was worried about is whether we were still able to recover pre-rotated keys in a <code>delegate</code>, that that kept working the same way as before the simplification. And after my round of testing, it did.\

Many applications of self-certifying identifiers only require temporary use after which the identifier is abandoned. These are called ephemeral identifiers. Other applications may only attach a limited amount of value to the identifier such that replacing the identifier is not onerous.\
Because a non-transferable (ephemeral) identifier is not recoverable in the event of compromise, the only recourse is to replace the identifier with another identifier. In some applications this may be preferable, given the comparable simplicity of maintaining key state.\
In either of these cases a non-transferable self-certifying identifier is sufficient.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="q-could-you-give-an-example-of-solely-a-cryptographically-verifiable-inception-statement">*<!-- -->*<!-- -->Q: Could you give an example of solely a cryptographically verifiable inception statement<a href="#q-could-you-give-an-example-of-solely-a-cryptographically-verifiable-inception-statement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to q-could-you-give-an-example-of-solely-a-cryptographically-verifiable-inception-statement" title="Direct link to q-could-you-give-an-example-of-solely-a-cryptographically-verifiable-inception-statement">​</a></h2><p>This is a basic self certifying identifier (<code>SCI</code>). The identifier itself is derived from a public key that is in the identifier. Nothing is connecting that binding of the identifier to the inception statement. Someone could create an different inception statement with other fields, the only thing that need to be the same is the key list. Everything else in the inception statement could be different.\
So that means the only way to know which inception statement is the right one is duplicity detection. So <code>First seen</code> becomes the only means you have to check which inception statement is the authoritative for that identifier, in case you need an inception statement.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="q-could-you-give-an-example-of-strongly-binding-the-inception-statement-to-the-identifier">*<!-- -->*<!-- -->Q: Could you give an example of strongly binding the inception statement to the identifier<a href="#q-could-you-give-an-example-of-strongly-binding-the-inception-statement-to-the-identifier" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to q-could-you-give-an-example-of-strongly-binding-the-inception-statement-to-the-identifier" title="Direct link to q-could-you-give-an-example-of-strongly-binding-the-inception-statement-to-the-identifier">​</a></h2><p>This a self-addressing self-certifying identifier (<code>SASCI</code>) In this case the identifier itself is derived from the inception statement. Now there can only be one inception statement for this identifier. If you&#x27;d change just a single bit, other than the identifier field itself, and it&#x27;s <em>different</em> identifier. You can&#x27;t have duplicitous inception statements. It&#x27;s not possible. It locks down at least the inception part and that help in duplicity detection. There can only be one inception statement to start a duplicity log with. From that point on you can have duplicitous next events, but not before. But it still means the effort it takes has to engage in CreatING duplicity, becomes much harder because for example if you include witnesses in the inception statement then any duplicitous event has to publish through the witnesses, and that adds a barrier. Basically it locks down at least the inception part, You can&#x27;t change it.\
In some cases it would be useful to be able to strongly bind the inception statement to the identifier and not merely rely on a cryptographically verifiable inception statement for the associated identifier.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="q-why-ever-go-for-a-basic-self-certifying-identifier-sci-when-keri-offers-self-addressing-sci-sasci-with-a-better-security-guarantee">*<!-- -->*<!-- -->Q: Why ever go for a basic self-certifying identifier (<code>SCI</code>) when KERI offers self addressing SCI (<code>SASCI</code>) with a better security guarantee?<a href="#q-why-ever-go-for-a-basic-self-certifying-identifier-sci-when-keri-offers-self-addressing-sci-sasci-with-a-better-security-guarantee" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to q-why-ever-go-for-a-basic-self-certifying-identifier-sci-when-keri-offers-self-addressing-sci-sasci-with-a-better-security-guarantee" title="Direct link to q-why-ever-go-for-a-basic-self-certifying-identifier-sci-when-keri-offers-self-addressing-sci-sasci-with-a-better-security-guarantee">​</a></h2><p>Because there are many applications where you don&#x27;t want to have to depend on a KEL because a basic SCI is self-certifying without a KEL. It&#x27;s more light-weight. For example the non-transferable version of a SCI you can still have an inception event so that basically any tracking anybody does there is still a nominal KEL for that identifier so you can look it up that way, discovering everything, there is always a legitimate version of an inception event for every identifier.</p><p>In many cases you want identifiers that are ephemeral, that you know the only event that could be would be is the inception event. You don&#x27;t need to see the inception event, if you&#x27;re using it in an ephemeral context.\
E.g. witnesses use ephemeral SCIs so I don&#x27;t need a key event log for a witness to verify a signature by a witness. You can do that with watchers as well. In applications like <code>IOT</code> where you need light-weight identifiers, you will mostly use SCI (1.). So you would use the basic version.</p><p>Want you don&#x27;t need to do with the basic identifiers is you don&#x27;t have to say &#x27;I got an identifier but I can&#x27;t verify the keys before I get the KEL so I don&#x27;t know the key state&#x27;. For the witness there is no key state. There is only ever one key. If the witness is ever compromised, then you get rid of the witness. You can rotate keys or rotate identifiers.\
Rotating an identifier is allowing us to change the keys for an ephemeral identifier.\
In an ephemeral context rotating the keys is the equivalent to rotating the identifier.\</p><blockquote><p>Example BTC and ETH they are ephemeral public keys, you can&#x27;t rotate keys in BTC without changing the identifier.

From a discussion about the security of <em>infrastructure</em> to a discussion about the security of your <em>key management infrastructure</em>. Most people when they think security, the think &quot;oh, blockchain!&quot;: permission-ed or permission-less, how hard is it to get 51% attack, etc.Non of that matters for KERI. KERI is all about &quot;are your private keys private?!&quot; And if <em>yes</em>, that drastically slims down the security discussion to brute force attacks to public keys. And because the next public keys are in fact protected by a hash, you have to brute force the hash algorithm, that is post-quantum secure.
So that is a very high level of infrastructural security.</p><p>So private key management and protection is the root of your security in KERI.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="q-can-i-rotate-keys-with-tangem-in-keri">*<!-- -->*<!-- -->Q: Can I rotate keys with Tangem in KERI?<a href="#q-can-i-rotate-keys-with-tangem-in-keri" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to q-can-i-rotate-keys-with-tangem-in-keri" title="Direct link to q-can-i-rotate-keys-with-tangem-in-keri">​</a></h2><p><em>Suppose I&#x27;d trust a Tangem card for generating public private key pairs at will and the NFC communication allowing to interact with a wallet app.</em></p><p>One of the main concerns is that there is a theoretical link (a binding) between the cards and a user, via the card-ID (CID). However the CID is used only for checking the authenticity and integrity of the chip itself. Tangem publishes and anchors a list of CIDs with corresponding public addresses in a public blockchain. When checking authenticity, the verifier looks up the pub CID and corresponding pub address in the published list, and verifies that the chip controls the correct pub address by means of a challenge-response scheme.
Even though for blockchain or SSI interactions, a completely new wallet with new pub/priv key pair is generated, the pub/priv key of the CID is used when the authenticity of the chip is checked by means of a challenge response scheme. Everything happens in the client app (2021: iOS or Android; and the client code is open source), where there is no communication with Tangem, so Tangem is not able to see any activity conducted by this CID in an authenticity check.
The CID and corresponding key pairs are not used in any other interaction. A new wallet with new pub/private key pair is generated on chip, with these keys being used for any transactions, signing, etc.</p><p>Q: With the chip firmware being proprietary, how can we be sure that the newly generated private keys for new wallets are not still linked somehow to the cards CID?
A: The firmware is audited by Kudelski and can be verified with a published hash.
TBD: How can it be verified, when and by whom? If the firmware is not open source, then somebody has to draw a hash from it in an authorized situation. However, Tangem cards are EAL6+ and FIDO2 certified.</p><p>On the issue of Rotation:

Getting a full copy is all you need. When retrieving a KEL over a network, then as you say a witness can prune some amount of the latest events, but every witness would have to be compromised for that to be undetectable.\
If parties are so concerned, they could establish a large collectivized set of witnesses that sign and distribute all key events presented to this network (this would essentially be a <code>Proof of Authority</code>/federated blockchain but would require (configurable)% compromise for undetectable pruning of recent history. Only PoA/federated because the witness sets are designated by the controllers, so you could not just use arbitrary witnesses who join and leave the network at leisure (afaik).</p><p>The difference between the chain and the DHT is that not all DHT nodes act as witnesses for all KELs in the system (in the sense that they don&#x27;t provide receipts for every KEL and aren&#x27;t referenced in the witness sets of every KEL), but they could all (or at least the ones holding the KEL you seek) still provide availability for KELs and thus would have to all be compromised in order to hide a recent-history-pruning, only one has to transmit the new/complete version to prove all the other versions as being old/incomplete.\
<em>(CharlesCunningham)</em></p><p>The point of KERI is to encapsulate all the guarantees within <code>KEL</code>s nothing else is needed. DHT is just for resolution process to find a place from where I can get it. This place can change as you like I could even get it in p2p interaction from someone else. DHT seems to be the most reasonable way to build solid infrastructure for resolution process but none of the nodes can actually inject or tamper KELs so you don&#x27;t have to trust them or get any guarantees from them. Since if the node will miss behave it is very easy to detect that.\

They all are using a combination of multiple relatively weak attack surfaces that must be simultaneously compromised for a successful attack. So multiplying simultaneous weak surfaces = functional equivalent of a stronger attack surface. So when you look at KERI you see that the security is primarily due to cryptographic strength and the witnesses are not the primary source of security but merely secure one thing, that is the availability of the KEL for an identifier. Not the KEL itself. The KEL itself is secured by signatures.\
From a Validator perspective their security is due to duplicity detection. Successful attack against duplicity detection requires an eclipse attack. Ledgers such as bitcoin are also susceptible to eclipse attacks. So in an apples to apples (resistance to eclipse attack) a KERI watcher network of comparable reach (1000&#x27;s of watchers) would have comparable resistance to an eclipse attack.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="q-differences-between-blockchain-based-security-and-keri-security">*<!-- -->*<!-- -->*<!-- -->Q: Differences between blockchain-based security and KERI security<a href="#q-differences-between-blockchain-based-security-and-keri-security" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to q-differences-between-blockchain-based-security-and-keri-security" title="Direct link to q-differences-between-blockchain-based-security-and-keri-security">​</a></h3><ul><li>Where KERI doesn&#x27;t need total ordering in its logs, blockchain do need that.

<em>Question: how does FIFO prevent effective DOS attacks?</em></p><p>By load-balancing the incoming messages. If you don&#x27;t have any load-balancing, the messages are going to be processed First In First Out. Only when an attacker has full bandwidth available to overload the buffer, they could frustrate the process to get honest messages in.
As soon as you’re able to balance the receipt of messages in the buffer, you’ll be able to get the right messages (from honest senders) through.

Actually KERI with witnesses and KAACE looks the most like Stellar an open permission-less <code>Byzantine Agreement</code> algorithm. If these concepts are unfamiliar to you, yu might as a result have no intuition about why KERI could work because you then have little familiarity with distributed consensus mechanisms that provide PoW like guarantees, but are not <code>PoW</code>.\
Actually BA came years before PoW so its the other way around (PoW provides BA like guarantees) but thats a quibble. So anyone trying to grasp how KERI security is guaranteed should first learn how <em>non-PoW</em> BA works before he/she could begin to believe why KERI could even work at all.

I.e. all the transactions from all the clients are combined into one set with one ordering = one total ordering. Most people can&#x27;t define this correctly whenever asked.</p><p>Byzantine fault tolerant total ordering is the hard problem of distributed consensus. <strong>Safe agreement which is all that KERI provides is much much simpler.</strong> So almost any witness structure is much simpler and will still work good enough.

Distributed consensus describes a family of algorithms of which BFT Total Ordering distributed consensus is a subset. Pretty much all cloud databases that have redundant copies use some form of distributed consensus for synchronizing the copies of the database. They all use some form of authentication for securing that consensus but they are not in any real sense of the term using Byzantine Fault tolerant total ordering distributed consensus. Setting up witness pools and watcher pools in KERI is of comparable complexity to spinning up a redundant Postgres or CouchDB cluster. So KERI&#x27;s guarantees come from nothing much more complicated than that. Nobody thinks that a CouchDB cluster is too complex to understand but few actually know the algorithmic details of its low level of distributed consensus.\
