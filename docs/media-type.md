## Definition
A Media type (formerly known as _MIME type_) is a standard way to indicate the nature and format of a file, like 'image/jpeg' for JPEG images, used on the internet.

It is a two-part identifier for file formats and format contents transmitted on the internet. Their purpose is somewhat similar to file extensions in that they identify the intended data format.

The [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority) is the official authority for the standardization and publication of these classifications.
