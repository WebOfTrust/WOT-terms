## KERI event stream

A stream of verifiable KERI data, consisting of the key event log (KEL) and other data such as a transaction event log (TEL). This data is a CESR event stream (TODO: link to IANA application/cesr media type) and may be serialized in a file using CESR encoding. We refer to these CESR stream resources as KERI event streams to simplify the vocabulary. See WebOfTrust glossary for more detail.
