## autonomic identifier (AID)

A self-certifying identifier (SCID) that is cryptographically bound cryptographically bound to a key event log (KEL), as defined by the KERI specification. An AID is either non-transferable or transferable. A non-transferable AID does not support key rotation while a transferable AID supports key rotation using a key pre-rotation mechanism that enables the AID to persist in spite of the evolution of its key state. See WebOfTrust glossary for more detail.
