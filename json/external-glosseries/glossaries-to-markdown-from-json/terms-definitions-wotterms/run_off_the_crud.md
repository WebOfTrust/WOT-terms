## run off the crud

<h4>Definition</h4><p><em>RUN off the <a href="CRUD">CRUD</a></em> </p><p>RUN stands for Read , Update,  Nullify. Why is it preferred (&#39;run off&#39;) over the CRUD (Create, Update, Delete)?</p><p>Consider the need to protect &#39;<em>authentic data</em>&#39; in a decentralized environment.</p><p>In a decentralized control model, the data always originates from a controller (aka client). The data created (sourced) by the controller follows the principle of &#39;<em>Non-Interactive Replay Monotonicity</em>&#39; to be able to protect the data from a replay (events are changed) or a deletion (some events are deleted) attacks. That is to say, the data (or events comprising it) is never deleted, it&#39;s rather always added to via updates. Each update, therefore, forms a verifiable, continuous log ( e.g. by providing growing sequence number, date timestamp, etc for each update). To enable invalidation of data, a special update, called Nullify, is used.</p><p>The client, therefore, updates the server (it&#39;s peer or peers), which just maintains the log following certain rules (see <a href="best-available-data-acceptance-mechanism">BADA</a> - Best Available Data Acceptance).</p><p>To summarise, the server can only Read the log, add Updates to it, including Nullifying ones. So <em>no</em> Create or Delete.</p>
