<h4>Definition</h4><p>HIO is an acronym which stands for &#39;Weightless hierarchical asynchronous coroutines and I/O in Python&#39;.</p><p>It&#39;s Rich Flow Based Programming Hierarchical Structured Concurrency with Asynchronous IO. That mouthful of terms has been explained further on <a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio">Github</a>.</p><p>HIO builds on very early work on hierarchical structured concurrency with lifecycle contexts from <a href="https://ioflo.com/">ioflo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ioflo/ioflo">ioflo github</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ioflo/ioflo_manuals">ioflo manuals</a>.</p><h5>More info on Github</h5><p><a href="https://github.com/ioflo/hio">Repo ioflo hio</a></p>
