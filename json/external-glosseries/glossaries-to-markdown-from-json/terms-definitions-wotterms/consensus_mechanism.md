<h4>Definition</h4><p>How groups of entitities come to decisions. In general to learn about consensus mechanisms read any textbook on decision making, automated reasoning, multi-objective decision making, operations research etc.</p><h4>Overall reliability</h4><p>A fundamental problem in distributed computing and multi-agent systems is to achieve overall system reliability in the presence of a number of faulty processes. This often requires coordinating processes to reach consensus, or agree on some data value that is needed during computation.</p><h4>More information</h4><p>More on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">wikipedia</a> or in this <a href="https://cryptoresearch.report/crypto-research/consensus-mechanisms/">2018 report</a> from the cryptocurrency field.</p>
