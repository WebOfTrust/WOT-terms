## non transferable identifier

<h4>Definition</h4><p>Controlling keys over this identifier cannot be rotated and therefore this identifier is <a href="non-transferable">non-transferable</a> to other control.<br>An identifier of this type has specific positive features like short-lived, peer to peer, one-time use, discardable, etc. that are very practical in certain use cases. Moreover non-transferable identifiers are much easier to govern than persistent identifiers that are <a href="transferable">transferable</a>.</p><h4>KERI related</h4><p>The KERI design approach is to build composable primitives instead of custom functionality that is so typical of other DKMI approaches:</p><ul><li><a href="transferable-identifier">transferable identifiers</a></li><li>non-transferable identifiers</li><li><a href="delegated-identifier">delegated identifiers</a></li></ul>
