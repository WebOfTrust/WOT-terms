### web of trust

<h4>Definition</h4><p>In cryptography, a web of trust is a concept used in <a href="PGP">PGP</a>, <a href="gnu-privacy-guard">GnuPG</a>, and other <code>OpenPGP</code>-compatible systems to establish the authenticity of the binding between a public key and its owner.<br>Its <em>decentralized</em> trust model is an alternative to the centralized trust model of a public key infrastructure (<code>PKI</code>), which relies exclusively on a certificate authority (or a hierarchy of such). As with computer networks, there are many independent webs of trust, and any user (through their identity certificate) can be a part of, and a link between, multiple webs. The web of trust concept was first put forth by PGP creator Phil Zimmermann in 1992 in the manual for PGP.</p><img src="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri/raw/main/images/web-of-trust.png" alt="Web of trust illustration" border="0" width="500" /><p>More on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust">Wikipedia</a></p>
