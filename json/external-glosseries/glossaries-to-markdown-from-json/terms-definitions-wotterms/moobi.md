## moobi

<h4>Definition</h4><p>Multi <a href="OOBI">OOBI</a> would allow to share a bunch of different end-points (oobis) all at once. A way for a single store to share multiple endpoints for that store. </p><h4>Limitation</h4><p>Those oobis would still need a way to authorize the endpoint provider, the endpoint role, for each of the different things. A multi-sig becomes a messy collaboration effort, especially when you take into account signing at the edge. You would need an authorization record for each end-point. And then pass this to all the members and ask them to collaborate.</p><h4>Also see</h4><p>Source: Philip Feairheller <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keri/discussions/39">KERI-dev meeting</a> July 27 2023</p>
