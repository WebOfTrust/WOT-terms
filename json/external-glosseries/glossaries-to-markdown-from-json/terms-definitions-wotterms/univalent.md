## univalent

<h4>Definition</h4><p>In identifier systems, univalent means having a unique and non-ambiguous identifier for each entity or resource. This means that there is a <em>one-to-one correspondence</em> between the identifiers and the entities, and that no two different entities share the same identifier.

To protect both the key generation and storage and the event signing infrastructures. . Consequently, a given protection mechanism may co-locate both infrastructures. This means facilities are shared.  This combined infrastructure is refered to as a <em>univalent</em> key management infrastructure. </p><p><img src="https://github.com/weboftrust/WOT-terms/static/img/univalent-key-management-infrastructure.png" alt="univalent-key-management-infrastructure"></p><p>A more secure albeit less convenient or performant univalent key management infrastructure may use special computing devices or components to store private keys and/or create signatures.</p><h4>Also see</h4><p><a href="multi-valent">Multivalent</a><a href="bivalent">Bivalent</a></p>
