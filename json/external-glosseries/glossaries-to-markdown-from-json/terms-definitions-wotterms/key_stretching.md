### key stretching

<h4>Definition</h4><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptography</a>, key stretching techniques are used to make a possibly weak <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)">key</a>, typically a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password">password</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase">passphrase</a>, more secure against a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack">brute-force attack</a> by increasing the resources (time and possibly space) it takes to test each possible key. </p><h4>Humans are predictable</h4><p>Passwords or passphrases created by humans are often short or predictable enough to allow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking">password cracking</a>, and key stretching is intended to make such attacks more difficult by complicating a basic step of trying a single password candidate. Key stretching also improves security in some real-world applications where the key length has been constrained, by mimicking a longer key length from the perspective of a brute-force attacker.</p><p>More on source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching">Wikipedia</a></p>
