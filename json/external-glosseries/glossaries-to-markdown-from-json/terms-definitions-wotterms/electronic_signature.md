### electronic signature

<h4>Definition</h4><p>An electronic signature, or e-signature, refers to data in electronic form, which is logically associated with other data in electronic form and which is used by the signatory to sign. This type of signature has the same legal standing as a handwritten signature as long as it adheres to the requirements of the specific regulation under which it was created (e.g., eIDAS in the European Union, NIST-DSS in the USA or ZertES in Switzerland).</p><h4>Digital signature implementation of e-signatures</h4><p><em>Electronic</em> signatures are a legal concept <em>distinct</em> from <strong><a href="digital-signature">digital signatures</a>, a cryptographic mechanism</strong> often used to implement electronic signatures. While an electronic signature can be as simple as a name entered in an electronic document, digital signatures are increasingly used in e-commerce and in regulatory filings to implement electronic signatures in a cryptographically protected way. </p>
