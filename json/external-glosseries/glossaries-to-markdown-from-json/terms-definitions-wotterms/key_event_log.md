## key event log

<h4>Definition</h4><p>A verifiable data structure that is a backward and forward chained, signed, append-only log of key events for an AID. The first entry in a KEL MUST be the one and only Inception Event of that AID.<br>Source <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri/blob/main/draft-ssmith-keri.md#basic-terminology">Sam Smith</a></p><h5>Put differently</h5><p>KELs are hash-chained Key Events. These are blockchains in a narrow definition, but not in the sense of ordering (not ordered) or global consensus mechanisms (which is not needed). (SamMSmith)</p><p>A KEL is KERI&#39;s VDS: the proof of key state of its identifier.</p>
