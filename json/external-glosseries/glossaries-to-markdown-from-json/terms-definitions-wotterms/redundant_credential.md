## redundant credential

<h4>Definition</h4><p>Multiple credentials issued by the same issuer (e.g. a <a href="QVI">QVI</a>). They do not have anything to do with each other. They are independently valid.</p><h4>Misbehaviour</h4><p>If a QVI issues two instances of the same credential, and is able to only revoke one. This is a governance issue and this behaviour of a QVI is not recommended. But it can be done this way (issue two revoke one) and it leaves the outside world with one other valid credential.</p>
