## control authority

<h4>Definition</h4><p>In identity systems Control Authority is who controls what and that is the primary factor in determining the basis for trust in them. The entity with <em>control authority</em> takes action through operations that affect the</p><ul><li>creation (inception)</li><li>updating</li><li>rotation</li><li>revocation</li><li>deletion</li><li>and delegation of the <strong>authentication factors and their relation to the identifier</strong>.</li></ul><h4>Source of truth</h4><p>How these events are ordered and their dependence on previous operations is important. The record of these operations is the source of truth for the identity system.</p><h4>Change control authority</h4><p>In the 2022 implementation of <a href="keripy">KeriPy</a> two <a href="rotation-event">rotations</a> were required to <em>change</em> control authority.In new rotation rules, you can rotate to new keys that aren&#39;t in the prior next key <a href="digest">digests</a>. You just need to reach the appropriate thresholds of <em>prior-next-threshold</em> and <em>current-signing-threshold</em>. So you now only need one rotation to change control authority.<br><strong>Note</strong>: This change was the forcing function to require <a href="dual-indexed-codes">dual indexed codes</a> in CESR.</p>
