## text binary concatenation composability

<h4>Definition</h4><p>An encoding has <em>composability</em> when any set of <a href="self-framing">self-framing</a> concatenated primitives expressed in either the text domain or binary domain may be converted as a group to the other domain and back again without loss.</p><h4>CESR related</h4><p>CESR is fully text binary concatenation composable.</p><h4>Example in analogy</h4><p>Use Google Translate to translate a piece of text from English to Dutch. Subsequently, keep copy pasting the resulting “to:” text into the “from:” field. The message changes until it comes to a standstill where you can keep swapping the texts without them changing.<br><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1e8_BbmMi.png" height="100" /><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1pFrbXfj.png" height="100" /></p><p>The conclusion is: Google Translate is not composable!</p><p>By contrast, CESR is composable. The <em>analogy</em> lies in the fact that we consider two languages. Suppose the English in the Google Translate example is <em>readable, text based</em> in CESR and Dutch is the <em>binary</em> form in CESR. Within these two CESR “languages”, text-based and binary, you can concatenate and swap freely as many times as you like — the data won’t change in between in their binary or text form no matter what content you express with them.<br>More explanation in <a href="https://medium.com/happy-blockchains/cesr-one-of-sam-smiths-inventions-is-as-controversial-as-genius-d757f36b88f8">source</a>.</p>
