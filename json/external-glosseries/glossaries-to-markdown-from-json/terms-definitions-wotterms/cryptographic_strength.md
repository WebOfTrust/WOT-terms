## cryptographic strength

<h4>Definition</h4><p>The term &quot;cryptographically strong&quot; is often used to describe an encryption algorithm, and implies, in comparison to some other algorithm (which is thus cryptographically weak), greater resistance to attack. But it can also be used to describe hashing and unique identifier and filename creation algorithms.<br>More on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_cryptography">Wikipedia</a></p>
