The term verifiable in this case comes from the term “Verifiable Credential”. A verifiable credential is just a collection of information with a mechanism that allows a computer to verify that the information has not been modified and that the information was originally stated to be correct by some third party (maybe a bank, or the driving license authority). Often (almost always really) the information will include a link to the entity the information is about.</p><h5>More information</h5><p><a href="https://rapidlei.com/what-is-vlei/">Here</a> at Rapidlei.</p>
