### pre rotation

<h4>Definition</h4><p>Cryptographic commitment to next rotated key set in previous rotation or <a href="inception-event">inception event</a>.</p><h4>Rotation</h4><p>The main purpose of <a href="rotation">key rotation</a> it to either prevent or recover from a successful compromise of one or more private keys by an exploiter. Given a potentially compromised private key, an exploiter could sign statements and even capture full control over the identifier by rotating the current key pair. </p><h4>Pre-rotation</h4><p>Pre-rotation mitigates successful exploit of a given set of signing private keys. There are several assumptions listed in <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">chapter Pre-rotation of the KERI white paper</a> about the circumstances under which pre-rotation is able to sustain this mitigation, e.g. it assumes that the private keys remains private until after issuance of the associated identifier.</p><h4>Origin and technique</h4><p>Pre-rotation is a new invention in KERI. Pre-rotation is a cryptographic commitment (a hash) to the next private/public key in the rotation-scheme.<br><a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">Source: chapter Pre-rotation in whitepaper</a></p>
