## cryptographic primitive

<h4>Definition</h4><p>Cryptographic primitives are well-established, low-level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">cryptographic</a> algorithms that are frequently used to build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_protocol">cryptographic protocols</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security">computer security</a> systems. These routines include, but are not limited to, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_hash_function">one-way hash functions</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher">encryption functions</a>.<br>More on source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_primitive">Wikipedia-page</a></p><h4>KERI related</h4><p>In KERI and ACDC it a serialization of a unitary value associated with a cryptographic operation including but not limited to a digest (hash), a salt, a seed, a private key, a public key, or a signature. All primitives in KERI MUST be expressed in <a href="composable-event-streaming-representation">CESR</a>.</p><h4>See also</h4><p>The more general term <a href="primitive">primitive</a>.</p>
