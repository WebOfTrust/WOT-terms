### indexed signature

<h4>Definition</h4><p>Also called <em>siger</em>. An indexed signature attachment is used when signing anything with a multi-key autonomic identifier. The index is included as part of the attachment, so a verifier knows which of the multiple public keys was used to generate a specific signature.<br>Source:Philip Feairheller</p><h4>Example working</h4><p>An indexed signature attachment would look something like:</p><pre><code>03.&lt;binary signature&gt;</code></pre><p>All encoded as <a href="qualified">qualified</a> <a href="base64">base64</a>.  A verifier would then know to use the AID’s public key located at index 3 in the list of public keys to verify the signature.<br>Source:Philip Feairheller</p><h4>Witness signatures indexed</h4><p>In addition, <a href="witness">witness</a> signatures can also be attached as indexed signatures. So a verifier can determine which witness signed a particular <a href="receipt">receipt</a>. This is useful when witnesses are receipting an event and only attaching their own signature. The <a href="controller">controller</a> knows which witness signed the receipt by looking up the index in their list of witnesses for that event.<br>Source:Philip Feairheller</p>
