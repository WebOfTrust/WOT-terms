## multi valent

<h4>Definition</h4><p>A delegator may have multiple delegates thereby enabling elastic horizontal scalability. Multiple delegates from a single delegator. Furthermore, each delegate may act as a delegator for its own delegates to form a <em>nested delegation tree</em>.<br>This allows mapping key management infrastructures to any hierarchically structured organization&#39;s computing infrastructure. With this construction, both security and performance trade-offs may be made as appropriate. Such an extended delegation setup we call a multivalent key management infrastructure.</p><p><img src="https://github.com/weboftrust/WOT-terms/static/img/multivalent-delegated-controller-key-management-infrastructure.png" alt="multivalent-delegated-controller-key-management-infrastructure"></p><p>Source <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/IdentifierTheory_web.pdf">Universal Identifier Theory</a> by Samuel Smith</p><h4>Also see</h4><p><a href="univalent">Univalent</a><a href="bivalent">Bivalent</a></p>
