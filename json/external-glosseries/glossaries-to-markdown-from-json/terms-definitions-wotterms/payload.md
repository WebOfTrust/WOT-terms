### payload

<h4>Definition</h4><p>The term &#39;payload&#39; is used to distinguish between the &#39;interesting&#39; information in a chunk of data or similar, and the overhead to support it. It is borrowed from transportation, where it refers to the part of the load that &#39;pays&#39;: for example, a tanker truck may carry 20 tons of oil, but the fully loaded vehicle weighs much more than that - there&#39;s the vehicle itself, the driver, fuel, the tank, etc. It costs money to move all these, but the customer only cares about (and pays for) the oil, hence, &#39;pay-load&#39;. <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/158603/what-does-the-term-payload-mean-in-programming">Source</a>.</p><h4>KERI context</h4><p>Now payload in <code>KERI</code>.
