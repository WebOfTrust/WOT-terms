## composable event streaming representation

<h4>Definition</h4><p>Also called &#39;CESR&#39;. This compact encoding scheme fully supports both textual and binary streaming applications of attached crypto material of all types. This approach includes <a href="composability">composability</a> in both the textual and binary streaming domains. The primitives may be the minimum possible but still composable size. </p><p>Making composability a guaranteed property allows future extensible support of new compositions of streaming formats based on pre-existing core primitives and compositions of core primitives. This enables optimized stream processing in both the binary and text domains.</p>
