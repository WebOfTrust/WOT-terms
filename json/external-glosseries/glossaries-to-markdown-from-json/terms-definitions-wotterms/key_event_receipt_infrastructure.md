## key event receipt infrastructure

<h4>Definition</h4><p>Also <code>KERI</code>. It&#39;s a new approach to decentralized identifiers and decentralized key management that promises significant benefits for <code>SSI</code> (self-sovereign identity) and <code>ToIP</code> (Trust over IP) infrastructure.<br>(<em>@drummondreed</em>)</p><p>KERI is an identifier system that fixes the internet. It&#39;s a fully decentralized permission-less key management architecture. It solves the <code>secure attribution problem</code> to its identifiers and allows portability.<br>(<em>@henkvancann</em>)</p><h4>Trust spanning layer for the internet</h4><p>While attribution has always been a non-exact science, we could come as close to attribution as “beyond a reasonable doubt”, those days are over with KERI.<br>KERI provides a trust spanning layer for the internet, because <strong>the protocol solves the secure attribution problem</strong> in a general, portable, fully decentralized way. There are more types of trust IN KERI but they all depend on the most important <em>attributive</em> trust.From KERI we&#39;ve learned that <em>secure attribution</em> is the essential problem for <em>any</em> <code>identifier system</code> to solve.</p>
