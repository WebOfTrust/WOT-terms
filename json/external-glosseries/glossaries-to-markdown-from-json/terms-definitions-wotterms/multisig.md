<h4>Definition</h4><p>also multi-signature or multisignature; is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature">digital signature</a> scheme which allows a group of users to sign a single piece of digital data.<br>Paraphrased by @henkvancann from Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multisignature">source</a></p><h4>KERI multi-signatures</h4><p>The KERI team has conceptually chosen for minimal sufficient means and so-called <em>dumb crypto</em>: &quot;&#39;Dumb technology&#39; is freely available, understandable to everyone and easy to implement. In our case: just hashes and digital signatures.&quot;</p><p>KERI has thresholded set of <a href="non-repudiable">non-repudiable</a> signatures.<br>KERI&#39;s CESR, and therefore KERI and ACDC is extensible with the latest more sophisticated multi-signature schemes like Schnorr signatures. </p>
