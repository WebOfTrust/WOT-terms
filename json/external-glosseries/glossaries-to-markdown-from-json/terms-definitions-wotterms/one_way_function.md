## one way function

<h4>Definition</h4><p>In computer science, a one-way function is a function that is easy to compute on every input, but hard to invert given the image of a random input. Here, &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; are to be understood in the sense of computational complexity theory, specifically the theory of polynomial time problems.<br>More on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-way_function">Wikipedia</a></p>
