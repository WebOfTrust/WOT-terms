## decentralized identity

<h4>Definition</h4><p>is a technology that uses cryptography to allow individuals to create and control their own unique identifiers. They can use these identifiers to obtain <code>Verifiable Credentials</code> from trusted organizations and, subsequently, present elements of these credentials as proof of claims about themselves. In this model, the individual takes ownership of their own identity and need not cede control to centralized service providers or companies.</p><p><code>KERI</code>s definition of decentralization (centralization) is about <em>control</em> not <em>spatial distribution</em>. In our definition <em>decentralized</em> is not necessarily the same as <em>distributed</em>. By distributed we mean that activity happens at more than one site. Thus decentralization is about <em>control</em> and distribution is about <em>place</em>. To elaborate, when we refer to decentralized infrastructure we mean infrastructure under decentralized (centralized) control no matter its spatial distribution. Thus <em>decentralized infrastructure</em> is infrastructure sourced or controlled by more than one <code>entity</code>.</p>
