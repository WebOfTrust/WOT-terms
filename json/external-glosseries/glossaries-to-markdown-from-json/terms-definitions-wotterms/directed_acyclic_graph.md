## directed acyclic graph

<h4>Definition</h4><p>From Wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">source</a>):</p><p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">mathematics</a>, particularly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">computer science</a>, a directed acyclic graph (DAG <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English">/ˈdæɡ/</a> (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/En-us-DAG.ogg">listen</a>)) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph</a> with no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_graph#Directed_cycle_graph">directed cycles</a>. That is, it consists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_(graph_theory)">vertices</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(graph_theory)">edges</a> (also called arcs), with each edge directed from one vertex to another.</p><img src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rywIzRLo5.png" width="219" height="300" alt="A directed acyclic graph (DAG)"/><h4>Why a directed acyclic graph (DAG)</h4><p>Following directions in a DAG will never form a closed loop. Steps through a DAG are finite. That&#39;s the main reason to choose for a DAG.</p><h4>Unique properties</h4><p>From Wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">source</a>):</p><p>A directed graph is a DAG if and only if it can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_ordering">topologically ordered</a>, by arranging the vertices as a linear ordering that is consistent with all edge directions. </p><h4>Applications</h4><p>From Wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">source</a>):</p><p>DAGs have numerous scientific and computational applications, ranging from biology (evolution, family trees, epidemiology) to information science (citation networks) to computation (scheduling).</p>
