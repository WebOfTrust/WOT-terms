## liveness

<h4>Definition</h4><p>Liveness refers to a set of properties of concurrent systems, that require a system to make progress despite the fact that its concurrently executing components (&quot;processes&quot;) may have to &quot;take turns&quot; in critical sections, parts of the program that cannot be simultaneously run by multiple processes.</p><h5>Meaning</h5><p>A <em>liveness</em> property in concurrent systems states that &quot;something good will eventually occur&quot;.</p><p>Liveness guarantees are important properties in operating systems and distributed systems.<br>Unlike liveness properties, <a href="#safety-properties">safety properties</a> can be violated by a finite execution of a distributed system. All properties can be expressed as the intersection of safety and liveness properties.<br>| TBW  | prio 2 how is liveness important in distributed systems? how does KERI guarantee liveness}</p><h5>More information</h5><p>On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liveness">wikipedia</a></p>
