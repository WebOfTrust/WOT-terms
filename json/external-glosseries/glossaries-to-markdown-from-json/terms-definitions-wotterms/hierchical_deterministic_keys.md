<h4>Definition</h4><p>A HDK type is a type of deterministic bitcoin wallet derived from a known <a href="seed">seed</a>, that allow for the creation of child keys from the parent key. Because the child key is generated from a known seed there is a relationship between the child and parent keys that is invisible to anyone without that seed.
