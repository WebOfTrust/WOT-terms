## lead bytes

<h4>Definition</h4><p>In order to avoid confusion with the use of the term <a href="pad">pad</a> character, when <a href="pre-pad">pre-pad</a>ding with bytes that are not replaced later, we use the term <strong>lead bytes</strong>. So lead-bytes are added &quot;pre-conversion&quot;.</p><h4>CESR related</h4><p>The term <a href="pad">pad</a> may be confusing not merely because both ways use a type of padding but it is also true that the number of pad characters when padding <em>post-conversion</em> equals the number of lead bytes when padding <em>pre-conversion</em>.</p>
