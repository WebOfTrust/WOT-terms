## non interactive authentication design

<h4>Definition</h4><p>A group of approaches having non-interactive mechanisms that pose unique problems because they do not allow a challenge response reply handshake. A request is submitted that is self-authenticating without additional interaction. The main benefits of non-interactive authentication are scalability and path independent end-to-end verifiability. These benefits become more important in decentralized applications that employ <a href="zero-trust">zero-trust</a> architectures.<br>More in <a href="https://hackmd.io/ZbVAbNK1SPyT90-oNwN_cw">source</a> Keri Request Authentication Mechanism (KRAM) by Samuel Smith</p><h4>Related</h4><p><a href="interactive-authentication-design">Interactive authentication design</a></p>
