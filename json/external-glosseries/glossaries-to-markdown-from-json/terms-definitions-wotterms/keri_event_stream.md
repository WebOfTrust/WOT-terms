## keri event stream

<h4>Definition</h4><p>A stream of verifiable KERI data, consisting of the <a href="key-event-log">key event log</a> and other data such as a <a href="transaction-event-log">transaction event log</a>. This data is a CESR event stream (TODO: link to IANA application/cesr media type) and may be serialized in a file using <a href="composable-event-streaming-representation">CESR</a> encoding. We refer to these <em>CESR stream resources</em> as KERI event streams to simplify the vocabulary.</p><p>Source <code>did:webs</code> <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-did-method-webs-specification/index.html">ToIP specification</a></p>
