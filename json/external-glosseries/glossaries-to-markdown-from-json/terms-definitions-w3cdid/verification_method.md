## verification method

A set of parameters that can be used together with a process to independentlyverify a proof. For example, a cryptographic public key can be used as averification method with respect to a digital signature; in such usage, itverifies that the signer possessed the associated cryptographic private key.        "Verification" and "proof" in this definition are intended to apply broadly. Forexample, a cryptographic public key might be used during Diffie-Hellman keyexchange to negotiate a shared symmetric key for encryption. This guarantees theintegrity of the key agreement process. It is thus another type of verificationmethod, even though descriptions of the process might not use the words"verification" or "proof."
