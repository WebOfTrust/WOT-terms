## terminology

<p class="c8"><span>Terminology is a group of specialized words and respective meanings in a particular field, and also the study of such </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.ojn7uxdcaf7u">terms</a></span><span>&nbsp;and their use; the latter meaning is also known as terminology science. A term is a word, </span><span>compound word</span><span>, or multi-word </span><span>expressions</span><span>&nbsp;that in specific </span><span>contexts</span><span>&nbsp;is given specific meaningsâ€”these may deviate from the meanings the same words have in other contexts and in everyday language.</span><span class="c2 c22"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology%23cite_note-2&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1706779842847863&amp;usg=AOvVaw0VsmZh8N7_4ARpcnCYQoBm">[2]</a></span><span>&nbsp;Terminology is a discipline that studies, among other things, the development of such </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.ojn7uxdcaf7u">terms</a></span><span>&nbsp;and their interrelationships within a specialized domain.
