### distributed ledger

<p class="c8"><span>A distributed ledger (also called a shared ledger or distributed ledger technology or DLT) is the consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronized digital </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.o783ayrrkc6g">data</a></span><span>&nbsp;that is geographically spread (distributed) across many sites, countries, or institutions. In contrast to a </span><span>centralized database</span><span>, a distributed ledger does not require a central administrator, and consequently does not have a </span><span>single (central) point-of-failure. I</span><span>n general, a distributed ledger requires a </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.ikjsqxobvozv">peer-to-peer</a></span><span>&nbsp;(P2P)</span><span>&nbsp;computer network and </span><span>consensus algorithms</span><span>&nbsp;so that the ledger is reliably replicated across distributed computer </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.w1aty8c036fp">nodes</a></span><span>&nbsp;(servers, clients, etc.). The most common form of distributed ledger technology is the </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.bxz57auzxstx">blockchain</a></span><span class="c0">, which can either be on a public or private network.</span></p><p class="c8"><span>Source: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1706779842657949&amp;usg=AOvVaw1kT7z3cHR5uEtz_VxHVeIw">Wikipedia</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
