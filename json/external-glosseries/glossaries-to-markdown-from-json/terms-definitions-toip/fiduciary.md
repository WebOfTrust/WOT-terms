## fiduciary

<p class="c8"><span>A fiduciary is a person who holds a </span><span>legal</span><span>&nbsp;or ethical relationship of </span><span>trust</span><span>&nbsp;with one or more other </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.cn6bno48fomj">parties</a></span><span>&nbsp;(person or group of persons). Typically, a fiduciary prudently takes care of money or other </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.emffux4xw3th">assets</a></span><span>&nbsp;for another person. One </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.cn6bno48fomj">party</a></span><span>, for example, a corporate trust company or the trust department of a bank, acts in a fiduciary capacity to another </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="#h.cn6bno48fomj">party</a></span><span>, who, for example, has entrusted funds to the fiduciary for safekeeping or investment. In a fiduciary relationship, one person, in a position of vulnerability, justifiably vests confidence, </span><span>good faith</span><span class="c0">, reliance, and trust in another whose aid, advice, or protection is sought in some matter.</span></p><p class="c8"><span>Source: </span><span class="c2"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiduciary&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1706779842671898&amp;usg=AOvVaw0KfaxFd0_AZZHQ5pBF_YOM">Wikipedia</a></span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
