## Welcome to the Web of Trust (WoT) project

We're reshaping Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) technology into a secure and scalable infrastructure to facilitate a trust-spanning layer for the internet through Autonomic Identifier Systems.

Our platform houses a variety of resources related to the [KERI suite](#KERIsuite). Our goal is to establish a common understanding of terminologies among SSI experts possessing developer skills and foundational knowledge in cryptography, SSI, and governance. 

### Main objective

To provide to-be KERI experts with "How to's", (a quick route to) explanation of concepts and choices, glossary and background information on their Intermediate KERI suite level of understanding. And assist them to reach the expert level as swiftly as possible.

#### Levels
- At a starting SSI-expert Level (1): What are the pieces of KERI suite
- At an intermediate Level (2): Answer to Why is it done this way?
- At the KERI suite expert Level (3): The ‘How’ for the devs and only for them. 

### Results
Users can rely on our resources, search through all of them, use our glossary service, and explore the choices behind the KERI suite. Our Github page features a [KERI suite search engine (KERISSE)](#KERISSE), and offers a personal learning environment at three distinctive levels of understanding. We welcome guest users starting at 'E-Identity expert' level, with a handy [chatbox feature](#chatbox) for guidance on SSI and KERI suite terminology.

What sets us apart is our effective resource management combined with a customized search engine ([Typesense](#Typesense)), delivering manageable and accurately ranked search results. We meld human expertise with [ChatGPT-4](#ChatGPT-4) from OpenAI to offer diverse levels of content, providing a unique edge over conventional platforms like Github or Google.

Our Github page provides insight into our:
