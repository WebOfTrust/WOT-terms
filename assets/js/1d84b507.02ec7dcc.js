To clarify, any information obtained from the service endpoint provided in the OOBI must be verified by some other mechanism. An OOBI, however, enables any internet and web search infrastructure to act as an out-of-band infrastructure to discover information that is verified using an in-band mechanism or protocol. The primary in-band verification protocol is KERI {{KERI_ID}}{{KERI}}. The OOBI protocol provides a web-based bootstrap and/or discovery mechanism for the KERI and the ACDC (Authentic Chained Data Container) protocols {{KERI_ID}}{{ACDC_ID}}{{OOBI_ID}}. Thus the security (or more correctly the lack of security) of an OOBI is out-of-band with respect to a KERI AID or an ACDC that uses KERI. To clarify, everything in KERI or that depends on KERI is end-verifiable, therefore it has no security dependency nor does it rely on security guarantees that may or may not be provided by web or internet infrastructure.  OOBIs provide a bootstrap that enables what we call Percolated Information Discovery (PID) which is based on Invasion Percolation Theory {{IPT}}{{DOMIP}}{{PT}}{{FPP}}.

The principal reason for this requirement is that KERI AIDs are derived in a completely decentralized manner. The root-of-trust of a KERI AID is completely independent of internet and DNS addressing infrastructure. Thus an IP address or URL could be considered a type of Out-Of-Band Infrastructure (OOBI) for KERI.

A verifier may thereby be fooled into believing that the replay is actually a new message and not a stale message. There are both interactive and non-interactive mitigations to replay attacks. Interactive mitigations use some type of nonce exchanged between updater and updatee. The nonce exchange introduces latency, scalability, and synchronization limitations. Non-interactive mitigations require a monotonic ordering mechanism. Typically monotonic ordering is based on logic rooted in a sequence number or date-time stamp.

For authentic data not directly anchored or included in a KEL, the relative key state (which is determined by the KEL) may be used in combination with a date-time stamp to ensure monotonic ordering.
