This composability property enables the round trip conversion en-masse of concatenated primitives between the text domain and binary domain while maintaining the separability of individual primitives. This enables convenient usability in the text domain and compact transmission in the binary domain. CESR primitives are self-framing. CESR supports self-framing group codes that enable stream processing and pipelining in both the text and binary domains. CESR supports composable text-binary encodings for general data types as well as suites of cryptographic material. Popular cryptographic material suites have compact encodings for efficiency while less compact encodings provide sufficient extensibility to support all foreseeable types. CESR streams also support interleaved JSON, CBOR, and MGPK serializations. CESR is a universal encoding that uniquely provides dual text and binary domain representations via composable conversion.

Cryptographically verifiable primitives provide essential building blocks for zero-trust computing and networking architectures. Traditionally cryptographic primitives including but not limited to digests, salts, seeds (private keys), public keys, and digital signatures have been largely represented in some type of binary encoding. This limits their usability in domains or protocols that are human-centric or equivalently that only support {{ASCII}} text-printable characters, {{RFC20}}.

But each application may use a non-interoperable encoding of type and optionally size.

Thus a textual self-framing encoding provides the core capability for a streaming text protocol like {{STOMP}} or {{RAET}}. Although a first-class textual encoding of cryptographic primitives is the primary motivation for the CESR protocol defined herein, CESR is sufficiently flexible and extensible to support other useful data types, such as integers of various sizes, floating-point numbers, date-times as well as generic text.

The addition of group framing codes as independently composable primitives enables hierarchical compositions.
