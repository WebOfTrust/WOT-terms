The schema for this verifiable credential would need to specify conditional subschema for the field labels at each nesting location that requires the full schema of the nested SAD or a string for the SAID.  The commitment to a SAID in place of a SAD contains nearly the same cryptographic integrity as a commitment to the SAD itself since the SAID is the qualified cryptographic material of a digest of the SAD.  The same credential could be converted to a compact credential containing the SAIDs of each nested block and signed as follows:"),(0,r.kt)("pre",null,(0,r.kt)("code",{parentName:"pre",className:"language-json"},'{\n   "v": "ACDC10JSON00011c_",\n   "d": "EBdXt3gIXOf2BBWNHdSXCJnFJL5OuQPyM5K0neuniccM",\n   "i": "EmkPreYpZfFk66jpf3uFv7vklXKhzBrAqjsKAn2EDIPM",\n   "s": "E46jrVPTzlSkUPqGGeIZ8a8FWS7a6s4reAXRZOkogZ2A",\n   "a": {\n     "d": "EgveY4-9XgOcLxUderzwLIr9Bf7V_NHwY1lkFrn9y2PY",\n     "i": "EQzFVaMasUf4cZZBKA0pUbRc9T8yUXRFLyM1JDASYqAA",\n     "dt": "2021-06-09T17:35:54.169967+00:00",\n     "ri": "EymRy7xMwsxUelUauaXtMxTfPAMPAI6FkekwlOjkggt",\n     "LEI": "254900OPPU84GM83MG36",\n     "legalName": "E2X8OLaLnM0XRQEYgM5UV3bZmWg3UUn7CP4SoKkvsl-s",\n     "address": "E-0luqYSg6cPcMFmhiAz8VBQObZLmTQPrgsr7Z1j6CA4",\n     "phone": "E6lty8H2sA_1acq8zg89_kqF194DbF1cDpwA7UPtwjPQ"\n   }\n}\n')),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"It is important to note that if this version of the credential is the one issued to the holder and the signature over the entire credential is on the serialized data of this version of the credential it is the only version that can be presented.
