The term takes its name from an allegory, the &quot;Byzantine Generals Problem&quot;, developed to describe a situation in which, in order to avoid catastrophic failure of the system, the system&#39;s actors must agree on a concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable.In a Byzantine fault, a component such as a server can inconsistently appear both failed and functioning to failure-detection systems, presenting different symptoms to different observers. It is difficult for the other components to declare it failed and shut it out of the network, because they need to first reach a consensus regarding which component has failed in the first place.Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) is the dependability of a fault-tolerant computer system to such conditions.</p><h4>Consensus two third</h4><p>A system has Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) when it can keep functioning correctly as long as two-thirds of the network agree or reaches consensus. BFT is a property or characteristic of a system that can resist up to one-third of the nodes failing or acting maliciously.</p><p>The pBFT model primarily focuses on providing a practical Byzantine state machine replication that tolerates Byzantine faults (malicious nodes) through an assumption that there are independent node failures and manipulated messages propagated by specific, independent nodes.The algorithm is designed to work in asynchronous systems and is optimized to be high-performance with an impressive overhead runtime and only a slight increase in latency.

For an <a href=\\"autonomic-identifier\\">autonomic identifier (AID)</a>, a controlling entity has the capability to make changes to the <a href=\\"key-event-log\\">key event log (KEL)</a> of the AID.

This is called <a href=\\"multisig\\">multi-signature (multi-sig)</a>. In a threshold multi-sig scheme, the control authority is split among the controlling entities, where each is assigned a weight.

These thresholded multiple signatures may be expressed as a single collective threshold signature when a collective signing scheme is used.</p><p>The control authority over an identifier can also be divided into signing authority and rotation authority. The controller of the identifier may grant their authority to other entities.

Anytime it gets a version count code it changes the version and also elevates to the top level (the version count code must appear at the top level). The version count code determines which CESR table to load when parsing the stream. The <a href=\\"sniffer\\">sniffer</a> detects if CESR binary, CESR Text, JSON, CBOR, MGPK. If any of the last three then the parser regexes to find the version string inside the JSON, CBOR, and MGPK and from the version string extracts the number of characters/bytes that is the length of the JSON, CBOR, or MGPK. The parser then resumes sniffing. When the sniff is CESR then when at the top level looks for the CESR version count code or any other count codes. The interpretation of the count codes is dependent on the version count code that is why the Parser has to start with a default version count code because the stream may not begin with a version code or may have resumed after a cold restart. When a count code is parsed then the parser may descend into parsing whats inside group for a group count code which may recursively nest down a ways.<br>Source Slack Cesride thread: Feb 2 2023</p>","url":"https://kerisse.org","anchor":"parside"}]},{"term":"partial disclosure","anchor":"partial-disclosure","definitions":[{"organisation":"WebOfTrust","definition":"<h4>Definition</h4><p>An ACDC attribute section can be a nested branch in a tree.

It is the cancelling of an act, the recalling of a grant or privilege, or the making <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(law)\\">void</a> of some <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deed\\">deed</a> previously existing.<br>More on source <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revocation\\">Wikipedia</a></p><h4>In identity</h4><p>The term revocation has two completely different meanings in the identity space. In key management one may speak of revoking keys. With statement issuance, authorization issuance, or credential issuance, one may speak of revoking an authorization statement, a token, or a credential.<br>This becomes confusing when the act of revoking keys also implicitly revokes the <a href=\\"authorization\\">authorization</a> of statements signed with those keys. Any statement may be effectively authorized by virtue of the attached signature(s) made with a set of <a href=\\"authoritative\\">authoritative</a> keys. The statement itself may be authorizing some other function in the system. So, the verification of the signature on an authorizing statement is essential to determining the authoritativeness of the associated authorized function. To clarify when an authorization is conveyed via a signed statement, the signature acts to authorize the statement.</p><h4>How KERI avoids confusion</h4><p>KERI terminology usually avoids confusion between <a href=\\"rotation\\">rotation</a> and revocation because a key rotation operation is the equivalent of a key revocation operation <strong>followed by a key replacement operation</strong>. So one operation, rotate, is implemented instead of two operations (revoke and replace).<br><strong>A bare key revocation is indicated by replacement with a null key.</strong> So only one operation is needed, that is, rotate where a special case of rotation is to rotate to a null key.</p><h4>Also see</h4><p><a href=\\"revocation-event\\">Revocation event</a></p>","url":"https://kerisse.org","anchor":"revocation"}]},{"term":"revocation event","anchor":"revocation-event","definitions":[{"organisation":"WebOfTrust","definition":"<h4>Definition</h4><h4>Considerations</h4><h4>KERI related</h4><p>An event that revokes <a href=\\"control-authority\\">control authority</a> over an <a href=\\"identifier\\">identifier</a>.

The threshold <code>M</code> indicates the minimum number of confirming witnesses the controller deems sufficient given some number <code>F</code> of potentially faulty witnesses, given that <code>M &gt;= N - F</code>. This enables a controller to provide itself with any degree of protection it deems necessary given this accountability.</p><p>Note that what may be sufficient for a controller may not be sufficient for a validator. To clarify, let <code>MC</code> denote the threshold size of a sufficient agreement from the perspective of a controller and let <code>MV</code> denote the threshold size of a sufficient agreement from the perspective of a validator. Typically, <code>MV &gt;= MC</code>. </p><h4>TOAD in KEL</h4><p>A controller declares TOAD in its <a href=\\"key-event-log\\">key event log (KEL)</a> during the <a href=\\"inception-event\\">key inception event</a> and may edit it during subsequent <a href=\\"rotation-event\\">key rotation events</a>.</p><h4>Purpose of TOAD</h4><p>A highly available system needs some degree of fault tolerance. The purpose of the threshold of accountability is to enable fault tolerance of the key event service with respect to faulty behavior by either the controller or witnesses. The principal controller fault exhibits duplicitous behavior in the use of its keys. In this case, the threshold serves as the threshold of accountable duplicity. The threshold lets a validator know when it may hold the controller accountable for duplicitous behavior. Without a threshold, a validator may choose to hold a controller accountable upon any evidence of duplicity which may make the service fragile in the presence of any degree of such faulty behavior. The primary way that a validator may hold a controller accountable is to stop trusting any use of the associated identifier. This destroys any value in the identifier and does not allow the controller to recover from an exploit. Recall that the one purpose of rotation keys (pre-rotated unexposed) is to enable recovery from compromised interaction signing keys. A compromised interaction signing key may exhibit duplicitous behavior on the part of the controller. A threshold of accountable duplicity enables a validator to distinguish between potentially recoverable duplicity such as the use of a compromised signing key and non-recoverable duplicity such as the use of a compromised rotation key. This better protects both the validator and the controller and improves the robustness of the service. </p>","url":"https://kerisse.org","anchor":"threshold-of-accountable-duplicity"}]},{"term":"threshold signature scheme","anchor":"threshold-signature-scheme","definitions":[{"organisation":"WebOfTrust","definition":"<h4>Definition</h4><p>or TSS; is a type of digital signature protocol used by <a href=\\"https://cryptoapis.io/products/wallet-as-a-service/mpc\\">Mutli-party Computation (MPC)</a> wallets to authorize transactions or key state changes.<br>Source <a href=\\"https://cryptoapis.io/blog/78-what-is-the-threshold-signature-scheme\\">Cryptoapis</a></p>","url":"https://kerisse.org","anchor":"threshold-signature-scheme"}]},{"term":"threshold structure security","anchor":"threshold-structure-security","definitions":[{"organisation":"WebOfTrust","definition":"<h4>Definition</h4><p>A threshold structure for security allows for weaker key management or execution environment infrastructure individually, but achieve greater overall security by multiplying the number of attack surfaces that an attacker must overcome to compromise a system.<br>In other words, with threshold structures, overall security may be greater than the security of any of the individual parts. </p><p>For example, in <a href=\\"multi-factor-authentication\\">MFA</a> the combination of two factors, something you have and something you know, may be much more secure than either of the factors by themselves.</p><h5>Threshold Structure Security vs. TEE Security</h5><p>Threshold structures may be employed in a complementary manner to trusted execution environments (<a href=\\"trusted-execution-environment\\">TEE</a>) for security.

A valid statement MUST be verifiable, that is, has a verifiable signature from the current controlling keypair(s) at the time of its issuance. Therefore a Validator must first act as a Verifier in order to establish the root authoritative set of keys. Once verified, the Validator may apply other criteria or constraints to the statement in order to determine its validity for a given use case. When that statement is part of a verifiable data structure then the cryptographic verification includes verifying digests and any other structural commitments or constraints. To elaborate, with respect to an AID, for example, a Validator first evaluates one or more KELs in order to determine if it can rely on (trust) the key state (control authority) provided by any given KEL. A necessary but insufficient condition for a valid KEL is it is verifiable i.e. is internally inconsistent with respect to compliance with the KERI protocol. An invalid KEL from the perspective of a Validator may be either unverifiable or may be verifiable but duplicitous with respect to some other verifiable version of that KEL. Detected duplicity by a given validator means that the validator has seen more than one verifiable version of a KEL for a given AID. Reconciliable duplicity means that one and only one version of a KEL as seen by a Validator is accepted as the authoritative version for that validator. Irreconcilable duplicity means that none of the versions of a KEL as seen by a validator are accepted as the authoritative one for that validator. The conditions for reconcilable duplicity are described later.<br>Source <a href=\\"https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri/blob/main/draft-ssmith-keri.md#basic-terminology\\">Sam Smith</a></p>","url":"https://kerisse.org","anchor":"validator"}]},{"term":"vault","anchor":"h.907j5xhvqo3u","definitions":[{"organisation":"ToIP","definition":"<p class=\\"c6\\"><span>See: </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.cz29glapo2tg\\">digital vault</a></span><span>.</span></p>","url":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fZByfuSOwszDRkE7ARQLeElSYmVznoOyJK4sxRvJpyM/edit","anchor":"h.907j5xhvqo3u"}]},{"term":"vcp","anchor":"vcp","definitions":[{"organisation":"WebOfTrust","definition":"<h4>Definition</h4><p>vcp = vdr incept, verifiable data registry inception</p>","url":"https://kerisse.org","anchor":"vcp"}]},{"term":"vdr","anchor":"vdr","definitions":[{"organisation":"WebOfTrust","definition":"<h4>See</h4><p><a href=\\"verifiable-data-registry\\">Verifiable data registry</a></p>","url":"https://kerisse.org","anchor":"vdr"}]},{"term":"veracity","anchor":"veracity","definitions":[{"organisation":"WebOfTrust","definition":"<h4>Definition</h4><p>The quality of being true; contrast <a href=\\"authenticity\\">authenticity</a>.

For identifiers that are declared transferable at inception, this control establishment requires a complete copy of the sequence of establishment events (inception and all rotations) for the identifier up to the time at which the statement was issued.<br>Source <a href=\\"https://github.com/WebOfTrust/ietf-keri/blob/main/draft-ssmith-keri.md#basic-terminology\\">Sam Smith</a></p><h4>ESSIF-lab definitions</h4><ul><li><em><a href=\\"https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary#verify\\">verify</a></em> definition is in sync with the definition in the KERI/ACDC vocabulary</li><li><em><a href=\\"https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary#verifier\\">verifier</a></em> definition is in sync with the definition in the KERI/ACDC vocabulary</li><li><em><a href=\\"https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary#validate\\">validate</a></em> definition is very general, however in the KERI/ACDC vocabulary &#39;validate&#39; currently has diverse meanings including this one</li><li><em><a href=\\"https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary#validator\\">validator</a></em> definition is a generalisation of the much more specific definition in the KERI/ACDC vocabulary</li></ul>","url":"https://kerisse.org","anchor":"verifier"}]},{"term":"verifier (of a claim or credential)","anchor":"h.xfewd7t01hu0","definitions":[{"organisation":"ToIP","definition":"<p class=\\"c6\\"><span>A </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.sf54cyuamo6x\\">role</a></span><span>&nbsp;an </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.6xkhfkjpo6xg\\">agent</a></span><span>&nbsp;performs to perform </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.2bnb6g8na7cu\\">verification</a></span><span>&nbsp;of one or more </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.r2qw6757lopw\\">proofs</a></span><span>&nbsp;of the </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.akieli6njkk5\\">claims</a></span><span>&nbsp;in a </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.ddna9lucn4k6\\">digital credential</a></span><span class=\\"c4\\">.</span></p><p class=\\"c6\\"><span>See also: </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.61sr3qnr1eci\\">relying party</a></span><span>; </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.xyrplzbvtffq\\">issuer</a></span><span>, </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.64mptmm24w7u\\">holder</a></span><span>.</span></p><p class=\\"c6\\"><span>Mental model: </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/%23roles&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1706043083279082&amp;usg=AOvVaw0mhhL_AadUITX3qCHAz4oc\\">W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model Roles &amp; Information Flows</a></span></p><p class=\\"c6\\"><span class=\\"c4\\">Supporting definitions:</span></p><p class=\\"c6\\"><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/%23terminology&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1706043083279403&amp;usg=AOvVaw0LTE0OgltMJoO2ov8n0gF3\\">W3C VC</a></span><span>: A role an </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/%23dfn-entities&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1706043083279608&amp;usg=AOvVaw2iX1oEao3JsnOJUUFcFj4Z\\">entity</a></span><span>&nbsp;performs by receiving one or more </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/%23dfn-verifiable-credentials&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1706043083279793&amp;usg=AOvVaw3c4rA6XLcD-vxWoMVe8z5e\\">verifiable credentials</a></span><span>, optionally inside a </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/%23dfn-verifiable-presentations&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1706043083279969&amp;usg=AOvVaw2flCeIzgASLKJzyWrbAQD3\\">verifiable presentation</a></span><span>&nbsp;for processing.

As more organizations do more computing outside their perimeter in the cloud, security teams find it increasingly difficult to trust or identify who and what should be allowed or trusted with access to their networks.

These principles are described at more length elsewhere but may be summarized as follows:</p><ol><li>Network Hostility. The network is always hostile, internally &amp; externally; Locality is not trustworthy. Solutions must provide means to mitigate network layer security vulnerabilities (man-in-the-middle, DNS hijacking, BGP attacks).  </li><li>E2E Security.  Inter-host communication must be end-to-end signed/encrypted and data must be stored signed/encrypted. Data is signed/encrypted in motion and at rest.  </li><li>E2E Provenance.  Data flow transformations must be end-to-end provenanced using verifiable data items (verifiable data chains or VCs). Every change shall be provenanced.  </li><li>Verify every-time for every-thing.  Every network interaction or data flow must be authenticated and authorized using best practice cryptography.  </li><li>Authorization is behavioral.  Policies for authentication and authorization must be dynamically modified based on behavior (reputation).  </li><li>No single point of trust.  Policies for authentication and authorization must be governed by end-verified diffuse-trust distributed consensus. Policy is protected by diffuse trust.  </li><li>Hosts locked down.  Hosts or host components executing any of the logic mentioned above must be locked down. Any changes to the host execution logic or behavior must be fully security tested and validated over the respective possible combinations of hardware and software platform. This means locking down key management and cryptographic operations on the devices. This includes key generation and storage, as well as signature generation and signature verification. These may benefit from the use of some form of trusted execution environment (TEE) either generally or specially as in a trusted platform module (TPM) or a hardware security module (HSM). In addition to key management and cryptographic operations, special security measures must be implemented regarding secure execution of the application logic (e.g. code injection, insecure object references, cross-site/service request forgery, cross-service scripting, etc.).</li></ol><p>Source: Universal Identity Theory by Samuel Smith</p><h4>Also see</h4><p><a href=\\"zero-trust\\">zero trust</a></p>","url":"https://kerisse.org","anchor":"zero-trust-computing"}]},{"term":"zero-knowledge proof","anchor":"h.zc9pf8eexjs","definitions":[{"organisation":"ToIP","definition":"<p class=\\"c6\\"><span>A specific kind of cryptographic </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.r2qw6757lopw\\">proof</a></span><span>&nbsp;that proves facts about </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.o783ayrrkc6g\\">data</a></span><span>&nbsp;to a </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.xfewd7t01hu0\\">verifier</a></span><span>&nbsp;without revealing the underlying </span><span class=\\"c1\\"><a class=\\"c2\\" href=\\"#h.o783ayrrkc6g\\">data</a></span><span class=\\"c4\\">&nbsp;itself.
