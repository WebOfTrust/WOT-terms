The fact that a number of community members are uneasy about EUPL is direct, concrete, timely proof that EUPL is a barrier to entry; the copyleft in the license scares people away. I KNOW this is true from first-hand experience, and I am confident that my experience isn't a weird anomaly. I believe Robert when he says that he hasn't encountered these barriers with his customers, but I suggest this is true because we are imagining two different kinds of usage. If companies just want to *use* tech that someone else writes, then copyleft is no big deal. All of us use GPL'ed stuff in linux all the time, without giving it a second thought.

I'm sure tons of EU lawyers have reviewed the license, and as I said, I think it probably IS the case that \"derivative work\" will end up being acknowledged to exclude source code linked to a library across an interface boundary -- in the EU.\n\nRobert cited a line from the license that says that if no other legal jurisdiction is identified, Belgium law applies. The \"if\" in the line is the problem, and it actually makes my point. Most companies that offer contracts to their customers identify a legal jurisdiction, and only ones that pick an EU jurisdiction will have the legal perspective that EU lawyers like. It's extremely common (almost universal) to pick the jurisdiction where a company is incorporated, because legal fees are less if the court is local. Thus, the statement that EU law applies if no other law is specified helps almost nobody outside the EU.\n\nA \"derivative work\" is NOT guaranteed to be evaluated according to an EU law perspective if a lawsuit is adjudicated in the UK or Mexico or Canada or Japan or the US. That's why I asked if there was case law or precedent that could be cited. I can't find any.

Thus, it is possible to consume the library either as a pre-compiled artifact or as unmodified source code without creating a derivative work.\nAs I understand it, that is what Robert is claiming the license already means, and what his intention is with respect to the EUPL-licensed cesrox. And that is what I claim is NOT guaranteed by the EUPL license in its current form, because it relies on a legal analysis that is only likely to be true in EU courts. \"Likely\" and \"in EU courts\" are both a problem.\n\nThe paragraph above is similar to the GNU Classpath Exception (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL_linking_exception#The_Classpath_exception>).
