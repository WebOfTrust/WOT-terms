Add a flag to the event signing method to indicate this expectation. A group member may willingly expect to be part of the next set of signers if they are transferring control of the identifier to someone else and would still sign. But if they are expecting to part of the next set of signers and their public key digest does not show up in the next list then it may a surreptitious attempt to wrest control away from them and they should not sign.\n• Update UX/UI to display the result of this check prior to signing to allows signer to indicate willingness to sign in spite of no longer being included.\n\n*Additional validation logic for rotation event*\n\n• Ensure that set of signatures satisfies both the previous next threshold `nt` from previous est event and the current key threshold `kt` of current rotation event being validated. Support for partial rotation means that prior `nt` and current `kt` do not have to be the same but must be both satisfiable. Prior `nt` must be satisfied by a subset of the public keys committed to in the prior `n` field list.

For example, LPGs (expressed using JSON Schema) are the basis for semantic interoperability of the <https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/draft-ssmith-acdc.html|ACDC> credential format used by <https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei|GLEIF vLEI credentials> that are on a path to be adopted by over 70 financial services regulators around the world.\n\nMy point being: by all means use `@context` when a credential uses a JSON-LD representation. That's the mechanism JSON-LD defines to control semantic validation in its representation of the VC data model.\n\nBut if a credential uses a different representation, that representation should define its own mechanism to control semantic validation.

The idea was that a namespace would be hashed to provide the first part of the identifier, and a complete data structure to provide the rest. I’ll now give a complete description that I believe will create an auto-governing system, potentially addressing Phil’s concern. Sorry for not using the typical one letter identifiers, I don’t know them off the top so I’m going to be verbose so that I can communicate clearly.\n\n```{\n  namespace: {\n   digest: \"E...\",\n   name: \"xyz.qui.domain.identifier\",\n   issuer: \"did:keri:E..\"\n  }\n  digest: \"E...\",\n  version: \"0.1.0\",\n  // other data\n}```\n\n\nIf we combine (`namespace.digest` | `digest`), we can create a fixed-length searchable (by digest of issuer and name) versioning system where only the identified issuer can create versions of their data.

Again, resulting in a better user experience.\n\nAt least, that is what I would imagine."}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"e20123486305","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2023-01-26/4704430470914_e201234863058e80ad8e_72.jpg","first_name":"Joseph","real_name":"Joseph Hunsaker","display_name":"Joseph","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"joseph.l.hunsaker","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false},"thread_ts":"1678976144.309779","parent_user_id":"U03QRSUA87Q"},{"type":"message","text":"<@U0448S72CQN> here is mine","files":[{"id":"F04UM936A59","created":1679185763,"timestamp":1679185763,"name":"Screenshot_20230318-182823.png","title":"Screenshot_20230318-182823.png","mimetype":"image/png","filetype":"png","pretty_type":"PNG","user":"U03QRSUA87Q","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","editable":false,"size":144358,"mode":"hosted","is_external":false,"external_type":"","is_public":true,"public_url_shared":false,"display_as_bot":false,"username":"","url_private":"https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0137GA6B7G-F04UM936A59/screenshot_20230318-182823.png?t=xoxe-1109554215254-6159027266387-6144595348759-e3efe8cf4db7cb269411a98a99c5f524","url_private_download":"https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T0137GA6B7G-F04UM936A59/download/screenshot_20230318-182823.png?t=xoxe-1109554215254-6159027266387-6144595348759-e3efe8cf4db7cb269411a98a99c5f524","media_display_type":"unknown","thumb_64":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T0137GA6B7G-F04UM936A59-40d8f0afe0/screenshot_20230318-182823_64.png?t=xoxe-1109554215254-6159027266387-6144595348759-e3efe8cf4db7cb269411a98a99c5f524","thumb_80":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T0137GA6B7G-F04UM936A59-40d8f0afe0/screenshot_20230318-182823_80.png?t=xoxe-1109554215254-6159027266387-6144595348759-e3efe8cf4db7cb269411a98a99c5f524","thumb_360":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T0137GA6B7G-F04UM936A59-40d8f0afe0/screenshot_20230318-182823_360.png?t=xoxe-1109554215254-6159027266387-6144595348759-e3efe8cf4db7cb269411a98a99c5f524","thumb_360_w":162,"thumb_360_h":360,"thumb_480":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T0137GA6B7G-F04UM936A59-40d8f0afe0/screenshot_20230318-182823_480.png?t=xoxe-1109554215254-6159027266387-6144595348759-e3efe8cf4db7cb269411a98a99c5f524","thumb_480_w":216,"thumb_480_h":480,"thumb_160":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T0137GA6B7G-F04UM936A59-40d8f0afe0/screenshot_20230318-182823_160.png?t=xoxe-1109554215254-6159027266387-6144595348759-e3efe8cf4db7cb269411a98a99c5f524","thumb_720":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T0137GA6B7G-F04UM936A59-40d8f0afe0/screenshot_20230318-182823_720.png?t=xoxe-1109554215254-6159027266387-6144595348759-e3efe8cf4db7cb269411a98a99c5f524","thumb_720_w":324,"thumb_720_h":720,"thumb_800":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T0137GA6B7G-F04UM936A59-40d8f0afe0/screenshot_20230318-182823_800.png?t=xoxe-1109554215254-6159027266387-6144595348759-e3efe8cf4db7cb269411a98a99c5f524","thumb_800_w":800,"thumb_800_h":1778,"thumb_960":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T0137GA6B7G-F04UM936A59-40d8f0afe0/screenshot_20230318-182823_960.png?t=xoxe-1109554215254-6159027266387-6144595348759-e3efe8cf4db7cb269411a98a99c5f524","thumb_960_w":432,"thumb_960_h":960,"thumb_1024":"https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T0137GA6B7G-F04UM936A59-40d8f0afe0/screenshot_20230318-182823_1024.png?t=xoxe-1109554215254-6159027266387-6144595348759-e3efe8cf4db7cb269411a98a99c5f524","thumb_1024_w":461,"thumb_1024_h":1024,"original_w":1080,"original_h":2400,"thumb_tiny":"AwAwABWg23A2k9Ocim4oqWWExqpLA5647UARHmjFFFADkRnPyqWx1p5jcj/VmpLT+P8ACrHAGBj69aAM8jBweopKdJ/rG+pptAEkchjzgA5qT7UwP3RTI1hZcvLtPpin+VAOsxH4U7AQE5JPrSU6QIrYR9w9cU3IpAf/2Q==","permalink":"https://keriworld.slack.com/files/U03QRSUA87Q/F04UM936A59/screenshot_20230318-182823.png","permalink_public":"https://slack-files.com/T0137GA6B7G-F04UM936A59-1519df3ae6","is_starred":false,"has_rich_preview":false,"file_access":"visible"}],"upload":false,"user":"U03QRSUA87Q","display_as_bot":false,"ts":"1679185772.950349","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"vwR0y","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"user","user_id":"U0448S72CQN"},{"type":"text","text":" here is mine"}]}]}],"client_msg_id":"f6b248fb-7c13-43cc-88b1-bcc8e30db1e6","thread_ts":"1678976144.309779","parent_user_id":"U03QRSUA87Q","subtype":"thread_broadcast","root":{"client_msg_id":"40412cc7-ea18-441f-af90-10cfcda1c1d6","type":"message","text":"The Nostr protocol is getting a lot of steam.

That is, it consists of vertices and edges (also called arcs), with each edge directed from one vertex to another, such that following those directions will never form a closed loop. A directed graph is a DAG if and only if it can be topologically ordered, by arranging the vertices as a linear ordering that is consistent with all edge directions.

See /face-to-face/index.md (<https://github.com/WebOfTrust/schema/blob/fdf204882a66de1e2babb8d9ee490b557c23c559/face-to-face/index.md>)\n\nI think the field you're imagining might be called something like `machineCheck?`? You described its relevance by referencing a face-to-face identification and imagined that the issuer has checked the issuee's physical ID. However, I don't imagine that an issuer does any identity checking at all before issuing this credential. That's because the purpose of an IRL credential has little to do with identification. The credential is supposed to prove that the issuee is a human, NOT to prove the human issuee's identity.\n\nI did put an optional field in the schema (`knownAs`) that would allow the issuer to say, \"here's a name that I use to interact with the issuee\" -- but if it's used, the issuer is not claiming that the name is legally correct or that it's an identifier others should trust or use -- only that it's something they themselves use. So if Alice and Bob meet at a conference, and Alice issues Bob an IRL credential, she could say that the issuee is `knownAs` \"BobTheIncredible\" to her, because that's what his nametag said -- but she wouldn't care at all whether that was his legal name or just a nickname he felt like scribbling on a nametag. The vital thing she has to check is that the party receiving this credential is a human.\n\nI also put an optional field in the schema for `confirmedHandles` . This is supposed to list email addresses or social media handles that the issuer has used to communicate with the issuee. Perhaps this overlaps a little bit with identification, clouding the purpose of the credential? However, if someone is a work colleague, and knows perfectly well a co-worker's github handle, it seems convenient to let them say so. Like `knownAs`, this is not making a claim about legal identity; if someone's Twitter handle is @bobTheIncredible, it still doesn't mean that's his name.\n\nThere is a final way that the current fields in the schema seem to overlap with what you are imagining, and perhaps this is the one that we should explore further. It is the `basis`field. This field intends to give a verifier some idea how deep the issuer's knowledge is of the issuee. So an issuer that says the basis of their credential is \"family\" is saying they've known the issuee intimately for years; \"colleague\" is another fairly strong but slightly different basis; \"acquaintance\" is the basis that Alice should assert for Bob when she meets him at a conference.\n\nI listed in example values for this field the values \"nist-ial2\". This would be a basis where someone would have to compare a person's live face to a credential like a passport. So if that basis is claimed, a `machineCheck` *might* make sense. However, I'm still not sure it's optimal, because if a person actually used a machine to check the validity of a passport, I suspect that the person who did this was working for an institution that requires NIST-IAL2 vetting.

An individual face-to-face credential provides moderate assurance (with a documented, specific basis) that the issuee is not an AI, an org, or an IoT device. See <https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17_QEAt5SIBOrKbZdkPW0K8XYNGyA4Fn8Tg-h0kvJTCE/edit?usp=sharing|this slidedeck> for background.\n\n<visual.png|suggested face-to-face visual>  \n  \nSuggested visual: <face-to-face-visual.svg|svg> | <face-to-face-visual-128.png|128 px> | <face-to-face-visual-64.png|64 px>\n\nFace-to-face credentials prove a party's humanness, NOT their identity. They do NOT replace high-assurance credentials such as passports, drivers licenses, or KYC, because they don't make strong claims about most of the legally definitive attributes of the issuees.\n\nIt is possible for Alice to work with Bob for years, and to issue Bob a face-to-face credential on that basis (`knownAs = \"Bob\", basis = \"colleague\"`), but to not know that Bob's legal name is actually Roberto. It is also possible for Bob to thoroughly deceive Alice about his name. Neither of these issues invalidates Alice's claim that the party she knows as Bob (whatever his legal identity might be) is a human being rather than a piece of technology or a faceless organization. _That_ is what a face-to-face credential asserts -- and until we have <https://futuretechenthusiast.com/10-most-realistic-humanoid-robots/|more realistic androids>, it is something Alice can decide easily, in even a brief face-to-face interaction.\n\nKnowledge about the existence of real-life humans is generated all the time, with virtually no effort, as we go about our ordinary lives. Thus, face-to-face credentials tap into a source of trust that is cheap, common, and neglected by heavier-weight mechanisms. Importantly, this knowledge is not dependent on institutions; face-to-face credentials democratize and decentralize trust on their focus question, and they limit <https://medium.com/@daniel-hardman/big-desks-and-little-people-e1b1b9e92d79|\"big desk and little people\" power imbalances>.\n\nFace-to-face credentials might be used to tell the difference between true and fake reports of a news event (since bots claiming to have witnessed the fake events should have trouble proving their humanness). They might be used as a replacement for a CAPTCHA. They might be a requirement for the issuance of other credentials that are intended to be held only by humans.\n\nAs with any credential, the trust that a verifier places in an individual face-to-face credential MUST depend on what they know about the issuer (`i` field). Trust SHOULD also be influenced by the data that the issuer offers about the nature and duration of the IRL interaction they had with the issuee (`basis` field). Multiple face-to-face credentials from issuers that are widely separated in time, kind, and public reputation are much harder to manipulate. Since high-assurance face-to-face interactions are common (work or school colleagues we've known for years, family and close friends), we hope that people give and get face-to-face credentials regularly, thus creating a web that provides pretty good assurance of humanness in many contexts.\n\n*Privacy*\n\nFace-to-face credentials allow (but do not require) the issuer to assert the name (`knownAs` field) and/or handles (`confirmedHandles` field) that they have _personally_ used to interact with the issuee. They also allow (but do not require) the issuer to endorse the hash of biometrics (e.g., a photo or voice print) that they agree characterized the issuee as they observed them in real life interactions (`biometricHashes` field). The issuee can carry the actual biometric data and present it to verifiers, thus allowing a verifier to confirm that they are interacting with the same human that the issuer knew.\n\nIssuing and later disclosing this information are both optional. Face-to-face credentials support contractually protected and graduated disclosure. Best practice for privacy would be to disclose no more than is strictly required.\n\nBy design, face-to-face credentials do not protect the privacy of the issuer. This means they should be issued by a public persona of the issuer, not a highly private one. Issuers and issuees should carefully consider the tradeoff between assurance and privacy that's associated with disclosing the nature of their face-to-face interactions in a face-to-face credential's `basis` field.\n\n*Governance Framework*\n\nThese credentials are governed by rules to enhance assurance, discourage abuse, and keep use cases crisp. The current rules are stated in <rules.json|rules.json> and are identified by SAID `EE1ycWdqBAE_4F-WsXZM83CrjpyCClYgPeINk104bLKX`. New governance frameworks can be written that modify these rules, but each credential MUST reference its associated rules using a SAID or a similar pointer to immutable content. The act of issuing or receiving a face-to-face credential constitutes binding acceptance of the rules.","title":"<https://github.com/WebOfTrust/schema/blob/fdf204882a66de1e2babb8d9ee490b557c23c559/face-to-face/index.md | index.md>","footer":"<https://github.com/WebOfTrust/schema|WebOfTrust/schema>","mrkdwn_in":["text"]}],"thread_ts":"1683044290.956759","parent_user_id":"U03RLLP2CR5"},{"client_msg_id":"bcf0303b-7772-4981-b4fc-8ecd0c764fbd","type":"message","text":"Just checking: Will there again be a strong KERI/ACDC delegation next IIW Oct 10-12?\nNow that the USA has let the unjabbed off the hook, I am able to join the party.","user":"U02PA6UQ6BV","ts":"1684277291.096669","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"9C3y1","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Just checking: Will there again be a strong KERI/ACDC delegation next IIW Oct 10-12?\nNow that the USA has let the unjabbed off the hook, I am able to join the party."}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"1bc9ec90c6a1","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2021-12-02/2792261386674_1bc9ec90c6a196211fa4_72.jpg","first_name":"Henk","real_name":"Henk van Cann","display_name":"Henk van Cann","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"hvancann","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false},"thread_ts":"1684277291.096669","reply_count":1,"reply_users_count":1,"latest_reply":"1684366528.350139","reply_users":["U03EUG009MY"],"replies":[{"user":"U03EUG009MY","ts":"1684366528.350139"}],"is_locked":false,"subscribed":false,"reactions":[{"name":"smirk","users":["U03QRSUA87Q","U03EUG009MY"],"count":2},{"name":"syringe","users":["U024CJMG22J","U03P53FCYB1"],"count":2},{"name":"no_entry_sign","users":["U024CJMG22J"],"count":1}]},{"client_msg_id":"2564C6BF-DBA7-4E5E-B284-7B0E59191D8D","type":"message","text":"Currently I believe Phil, Karla and myself will be there from GLEIF","user":"U024KC347B4","ts":"1684277365.827279","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"MxSb2","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Currently"},{"type":"text","text":" "},{"type":"text","text":"I believe Phil, Karla and myself will be there from GLEIF"}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"41d01831f101","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2021-06-09/2140690266103_41d01831f1013d41073b_72.jpg","first_name":"","real_name":"Kevin Griffin","display_name":"Kevin Griffin","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"griffin.kev","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false}},{"client_msg_id":"670eeb34-616d-468d-8c60-ab323039c4c6","type":"message","text":"Great, would be nice to finally meet in person.","user":"U02PA6UQ6BV","ts":"1684277445.113589","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"E3U","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Great, would be nice to finally meet in person."}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"1bc9ec90c6a1","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2021-12-02/2792261386674_1bc9ec90c6a196211fa4_72.jpg","first_name":"Henk","real_name":"Henk van Cann","display_name":"Henk van Cann","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"hvancann","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false}},{"client_msg_id":"275ed788-4909-4cba-9f04-8917cf879a86","type":"message","text":"I'm sure Sam will be there.","user":"U024CJMG22J","ts":"1684283587.102639","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"iD2U","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I'm sure Sam will be there."}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"g606bec523fd","image_72":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/606bec523fdd8d67313b404c09d5ae1f.jpg?s=72&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0011-72.png","first_name":"","real_name":"Phil Feairheller","display_name":"","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"pfeairheller","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false},"reactions":[{"name":"+1","users":["U02PA6UQ6BV"],"count":1}]},{"client_msg_id":"d12a70e8-30b4-4f29-9350-9f7b5eddf337","type":"message","text":"Thank <@U03RLLP2CR5> for clarifying, if I understand correctly, the goal here is not to \"officially\" identify who the person is, but to recognize that this is a human being.\n\nI read through the file you wrote.\nYou mentioned in the goal section that the goal is to recognize that it is a person and not an AI bot for example.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the schema has two optional purposes\n1.

A  \n_Public Verifiable Credential Registry_ can be represented in several TELs to establish issuance or revocation state of  \na Verifiable Credential (VC). The KEL is used to establish control authority over the keys used to commit to the events  \nof the TEL and sign the VC. The events of the TEL are used to establish the issuance or revocation state of the VCs  \nissued by the controller of the identifier represented by the KEL. This document specifies a design for _public_  \nVCs only. The use of a hash digest of the VC contents as the identifier of that VC or an attribute in a TEL event allows  \nfor correlation of uses of the VC.\n\n*Transaction Event Log*\n\nA KERI KEL can control a TEL by anchoring the TEL to key events of the KEL with the following:\n\n1. Create the inception event for the TEL with the TEL specific unique identifier.\n2. Generate a hash digest of the serialized content of the TEL inception event.\n3. Attach anchoring seals from the KEL events to the TEL events they are authorizing.\n4. Sign the KEL event as usual to commit to the digest of the serialized TEL event.\n\nAny validator can cryptographically verify the authoritative state by validating the signatures of the referenced KEL.  \nThe TEL events do not have to be signed as the commitment to the event is in the form of the digest in the seal in the  \nanchoring KEL event and the signatures on that event. Like KEL events, all TEL events have the fields `i`, `s`, and  \n`t`. However, the `s` or sequence number field in TEL events represents the \"clock\" for that transaction set. Each  \ntransaction set can have its own \"clock\" (e.g. bitcoin block height, wall clock, etc) and is independent of the sequence  \nnumber of the KEL events. In the case of the Verifiable Credential Registry, the `s` field is simply a monotonically  \nincreasing integer.\n\nThe events are anchored back to the KEL using Event Source Seals whose JSON representation is as follows.\n\n```\n{\n \"s\": \"3\",\n \"d\": \"ELvaU6Z-i0d8JJR2nmwyYAZAoTNZH3UfSVPzhzS6b5CM\"\n}\n```\n\nFor TEL events, this seal back to the KEL will be delivered as an attachment of event source seal triples in duple of  \n(s, d).\n\n```\n-GAB\n0AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAw\nELvaU6Z-i0d8JJR2nmwyYAZAoTNZH3UfSVPzhzS6b5CM\n```\n\nEvent source seal attachment example (line feeds added for readability)\n\n*Verifiable Credential Registry*\n\nA _Public Verifiable Credential Registry_ (Registry) is a form of a _Verifiable Data Registry_ that tracks the  \nissuance/revocation state of credentials issued by the controller of the KEL. Two types of TELs will be used for this  \npurpose. The first type of TEL is the management TEL and will signal the creation of the Registry and track the list of  \nRegistrars that will act as Backers for the individual TELs for each VC. The second type of TEL is the VC TEL which will  \ntrack the issued or revoked state of each VC and will contain a reference to it's corresponding management TEL.\n\nThe following events will be used to create and maintain the TELs for the Registry.\n\n*Management TEL*\n\nThe state tracked by the Management TEL will be the list of Registrar identifiers that serve as backers for each TEL  \nunder its provenance. This list of Registrars can be rotated with events specific to this type of TEL. In this way,  \nRegistrar lists are analogous to Backer lists in KERI KELs. Additional metadata can be tracked in this TEL, for example  \nreferences to Schema. The Management TEL will have two events: `vcp` for Registry inception and `vrt`  \nfor rotation of the list or Registrars. The events will reference the controlling identifier in the `ii` field and be  \nanchored to the KEL with an event seal triple attachment.\n\nThe Registry specific identifier will be self-addressing (see <https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy/blob/c3a6fc455b5fac194aa9c264e48ea2c52328d4c5/ref/tel.md#self-addressing-Identifiers|below>  \nfor definition) using its inception data for its derivation. This requires a commitment to the anchor in the controlling  \nKEL and necessitates the event location seal be included in the event. The derived identifier is then set in the `i`  \nfield of the events in the management TEL.\n\nThough it is possible for a given identifier KEL to issue multiple types of credentials, it is anticipated that there  \nwill be relatively few (usually one) Management TELs anchored to a given KEL. A more scalable approach to issuing  \nmultiple credential types from a single identifier would be to use delegated identifiers for the different types of  \ncredentials to be issued.\n\n*Configuration*\n\nThe simplest (and most common) case for Registries relies on the witnesses of the controlling KEL and their receipts of  \nthe KEL events instead of Registry specific backers. To accommodate this case, the `c` element is added to the  \nmanagement TEL inception event with the configuration option `NB` to specify that the Registry will never have backers  \nconfigured in the management TEL. In this case, there will only be one event in the management TEL for this Registry and  \nthe simple events `iss`  \nand `rev` will be used for \"simple issue\" and \"simple revoke\" respectively in the VC specific TELs. For these events,  \nthe `ri` field will be the simple identifier referencing the management TEL.\n\n*Registry Inception Event*\n\n```\n{\n \"v\" : \"KERI10JSON00016d_\",\n \"d\" : \"EOMBBz0AKgL1-n9OK5DAIQLM6Z1FHE35YGFUuveYiM1A\",\n \"i\" : \"ELh3eYC2W_Su1izlvm0xxw01n3XK8bdV2Zb09IqlXB7A\",\n \"ii\": \"EJJR2nmwyYAfSVPzhzS6b5CMZAoTNZH3ULvaU6Z-i0d8\",\n \"s\" : \"0\",\n \"t\" : \"vcp\",\n \"b\" : [\"BbIg_3-11d3PYxSInLN-Q9_T2axD6kkXd3XRgbGZTm6s\"],\n \"c\" : [],\n \"a\" : {\n     \"d\": \"EEBp64Aw2rsjdJpAR0e2qCq3jX7q7gLld3LjAwZgaLXU\"\n  },\n \"n\" : \"AAd7Zfk6072acq_37bw29qiHOkG3-vErjQGdtjPRmVE_\"\n}-GAB0AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwEOWdT7a7fZwRz0jiZ0DJxZEM3vsNbLDPEUk-ODnif3O0\n```\n\nRegistry inception event for establishing the list of Backers\n\n```\n{\n \"v\" : \"KERI10JSON00010a_\",\n \"d\" : \"EJwVS89RBfBNhX6PpAmpsssMSZDMW68FaYmEOSw8EFP6\",\n \"i\" : \"ELh3eYC2W_Su1izlvm0xxw01n3XK8bdV2Zb09IqlXB7A\",\n \"ii\": \"EJJR2nmwyYAfSVPzhzS6b5CMZAoTNZH3ULvaU6Z-i0d8\",\n \"s\" : \"0\",\n \"t\" : \"vcp\",\n \"b\" : [],\n \"c\" : [\"NB\"],\n \"n\" : \"AAd7Zfk6072acq_37bw29qiHOkG3-vErjQGdtjPRmVE_\"\n}-GAB0AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABwEOWdT7a7fZwRz0jiZ0DJxZEM3vsNbLDPEUk-ODnif3O0\n```\n\nRegistry inception event for \"backer-less\" configuration\n\n*Registry Rotation Event*\n\n```\n{\n \"v\" : \"KERI10JSON000130_\",\n \"d\" : \"EL0dsWLeW88h1yruLnEC5_7TT4jIKRiCZjssVRWAQRTz\",\n \"i\" : \"ELh3eYC2W_Su1izlvm0xxw01n3XK8bdV2Zb09IqlXB7A\",\n \"p\" : \"EY2L3ycqK9645aEeQKP941xojSiuiHsw4Y6yTW-PmsBg\",\n \"s\" : \"1\",\n \"t\" : \"vrt\",\n \"ba\" : [\"BXhpfP_H41hw8f-LluTidLfXxmC4EPwaENHI6CuruE6g\"],\n \"br\" : [\"BbIg_3-11d3PYxSInLN-Q9_T2axD6kkXd3XRgbGZTm6s\"]\n}-GAB0AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACQEOWdT7a7fZwRz0jiZ0DJxZEM3vsNbLDPEUk-ODnif3O0\n```\n\nRegistrar rotation event updates the list of Backers\n\n*Verifiable Credential TELs*\n\nThe binary state (issued or revoked) of each verifiable credential (VC) will be tracked in individual TELs associated  \nwith each VC. The state changes will be represented by 4 sets of 2 events: `iss` for simple VC issuance and `rev`  \nfor simple revocation, `bis` for the issuance of the VCs with backers and `brv` for revocation of the VCs with backers  \nand corresponding events `iis`, `irv` and `ibs`, `ibr` to be used when the identifier of the VC is not the  \nself-addressing identifier of the VC and that identifier must be included is the separate `vi` field in the event. The  \nevents will be anchored to the KEL with an event seal triple attachment signified by the grouping counter `-e##`.\n\n*Self Addressing Identifiers*\n\nThe advantage of a content addressable identifier is that it is cryptographically bound to the contents. It provides a  \nsecure root-of-trust.

This model bridges digital and non-digital\ninformation exchange. By considering the question of governed data usage\nthrough the angle of the Principal-Agent problem, we build a distributed\ngovernance model based on Autonomous Principals defined as entities capable of\nchoice, therefore capable of exercising a transactional sovereignty. Extending\nthe legal concept of the privacy sphere to a functional equivalent in the\ndigital space leads to the construction of a digital self to which rights and\naccountability can be attached. Ecosystems, defined as communities of\nautonomous principals bound by a legitimate authority, provide the basis of\ninteracting structures of increasing complexity endowed with a self-replicating\nproperty that mirrors physical world governance systems. The model proposes a\ngovernance concept for multi-stakeholder information systems operating across\njurisdictions. Using recent software engineering advances in decentralised\nauthentication and semantics, we provide a framework, Dynamic Data Economy to\ndeploy a distributed governance model embedding checks and balance between\nhuman and technological governance. Domain specific governance models are left\nfor further publications. Similarly, the technical questions related to the\nconnection between a digital-self and its physical world controller (e.g\nbiometric binding) will be treated in upcoming publications.","title":"Distributed Governance: a Principal-Agent Approach to Data Governance -- Part 1 Background &amp; Core Definitions","title_link":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07280","service_name":"arXiv.org"}]},{"client_msg_id":"af5ddd18-bc20-4b19-b066-447e68da270d","type":"message","text":"Hi, <@U04H17ZEX9R>.

Am I in the right ballpark?"}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"add08edec1fb","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2022-08-02/3887705521780_add08edec1fbb204a544_72.jpg","first_name":"Daniel","real_name":"Daniel Hardman","display_name":"Daniel Hardman","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"daniel.hardman","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false},"thread_ts":"1693993840.628339","parent_user_id":"U03RLLP2CR5"},{"client_msg_id":"887260cf-8177-4631-9401-4c7cc3491e9e","type":"message","text":"Actually, maybe processEvent in Kevery?","user":"U03RLLP2CR5","ts":"1695660696.730729","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"d=ZV","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Actually, maybe processEvent in Kevery?"}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"add08edec1fb","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2022-08-02/3887705521780_add08edec1fbb204a544_72.jpg","first_name":"Daniel","real_name":"Daniel Hardman","display_name":"Daniel Hardman","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"daniel.hardman","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false},"thread_ts":"1693993840.628339","parent_user_id":"U03RLLP2CR5"},{"client_msg_id":"6982ae4a-35d0-44b0-99fd-f475b839c072","type":"message","text":"Yes, they do","user":"U02PA6UQ6BV","ts":"1695720270.516399","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"RA5Q","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Yes, they do"}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"1bc9ec90c6a1","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2021-12-02/2792261386674_1bc9ec90c6a196211fa4_72.jpg","first_name":"Henk","real_name":"Henk van Cann","display_name":"Henk van Cann","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"hvancann","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false}},{"client_msg_id":"28d59d7c-449f-43fb-82c9-98d2c198bfb1","type":"message","text":"At most a week or eternally valid, the latter, I think, is not the one to go for.","user":"U02PA6UQ6BV","ts":"1695720331.708779","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"yrC15","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"At most a week or eternally valid, the latter, I think, is not the one to go for."}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"1bc9ec90c6a1","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2021-12-02/2792261386674_1bc9ec90c6a196211fa4_72.jpg","first_name":"Henk","real_name":"Henk van Cann","display_name":"Henk van Cann","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"hvancann","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false}},{"client_msg_id":"fd9f4e6a-06d9-45fb-b97c-ba07cd06bafa","type":"message","text":"We should consider shutting this down now that we've migrated to Discord.
