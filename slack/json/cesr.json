Essentially, review current work and make a complete list of work to be done."}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"b93afcd23af8","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2023-05-24/5315833935091_b93afcd23af8e5c45914_72.jpg","first_name":"Kent","real_name":"Kent Bull","display_name":"Kent Bull","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"kent","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false},"reactions":[{"name":"raised_hands","users":["U03P53FCYB1"],"count":1}]},{"client_msg_id":"28957f09-3d4e-46df-9495-a57a7f110df5","type":"message","text":"Yes, I’ll have that shared to this channel later today.","user":"U03EUG009MY","ts":"1664468786.025979","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"y8uj","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Yes, I’ll have that shared to this channel later today."}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"b93afcd23af8","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2023-05-24/5315833935091_b93afcd23af8e5c45914_72.jpg","first_name":"Kent","real_name":"Kent Bull","display_name":"Kent Bull","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"kent","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false},"thread_ts":"1664468419.759389","parent_user_id":"U03KLB48Q2E"},{"client_msg_id":"4c53b43e-7a92-404e-88be-7b286a884726","type":"message","text":"Yes, good idea.

DIF license all source code contributions are  apache2.

Unfortunately, DIF uses a combination of the W3C patent policy and the CC4 license for non-source code contributions and so that is where there is significant ambiguity especially since the W3C Patent Policy as written only provides provisions for management by the w3c not DIF.  In June of 2022 there was a determination by DIF that there were no patentable contribution to the DIF KERI repo for which the W3C patent policy would apply. So any pull requests from code donated to DIF before June of 2022 are clean. Anything after that we should not accept because there is ambiguity as to what is “source code” and what is not when it comes to contributions at DIF. Frankly I consider DIF’s IP policy to be broken because IMHO there is no way to unambiguously determine if a contribution is source code or not. For example is javascript or python code pasted into an issue raised on DIF’s github repo count as source code and falls under apache2? Or is it text and falls under CCby4, or is it a patentable description of a process?

There just isn’t enough legal precedent to trust such constructions. By comprehensive I mean all contributions of any and all kinds are covered by one license. One can have multiple comprehensive licenses where a given license takes priority for terms but allows for relaxed terms of use in some circumstance. but all contributions are still covered.

This composability property enables the round trip conversion en-masse of concatenated primitives between the text domain and binary domain while maintaining the separability of individual primitives. This enables convenient usability in the text domain and compact transmission in the binary domain. CESR primitives are self-framing. CESR supports self-framing group codes that enable stream processing and pipelining in both the text and binary domains. CESR supports composable text-binary encodings for general data types as well as suites of cryptographic material. Popular cryptographic material suites have compact encodings for efficiency while less compact encodings provide sufficient extensibility to support all foreseeable types. CESR streams also support interleaved JSON, CBOR, and MGPK serializations. CESR is a universal encoding that uniquely provides dual text and binary domain representations via composable conversion.

Is it your intent that consumers of the THC cesrox/keriox repos should be forced to license their applications (codebases that reside in other repos, and that consume cesrox/keriox functionality through its interfaces) under a compatible copyleft license?\nI am hoping that you will say, \"No -- only that any changes to cesrox/keriox itself must retain the EUPL or a compatible license. A derivative work is something that mixes or changes the source code of the work in question, not something that consumes the source code across an interface boundary.\"\n\nThat would be a happy answer.\n\nIf, instead, the answer is yes, then I can't consume your code and still honor your intentions, because I intend that some parts of my company's stack -- not the low-level parts, but certainly higher parts that still consume keri-and-cesr-in-rust -- have licenses that are not copyleft. I think many community members have a similar view.\n\nAssuming your intent about copyleft is narrow, this leads me to question 2:\n\n&gt; 2. Is it actually legal for a company to build an application atop an EUPL-licensed library without being forced to license the whole application with a copyleft license?\nIf the answer to this question is \"clearly yes\", then I don't think the EUPL is an adoption problem, and I will happily vote for the whole community to get behind the THC codebase. I will be a strong ally for you. But if the answer is anything less strong -- \"probably yes\" or \"maybe yes\" or \"no,\" then I believe there is a major adoption problem, despite your intentions, because legal caution and/or FUD will trump rational analysis.\n\nUnfortunately, my analysis leads me to believe the answer to question 2 is \"probably yes\" in the EU and \"maybe yes\" in other parts of the world. Please review my analysis and correct it if needed; I would love to be wrong.\n\nThe wikipedia article about EUPL has a section about strong copyleft. That section has the following encouraging quote:\n\n&gt; According to the GPL/AGPL licensor vision, this means some restrictions and conditions regarding interoperability (due to the theory that linking other software with the covered code creates a combined derivative) and regarding compatibility (since no derivative could be licensed under another license, which may create incompatibilities). The EUPL vision that is depending on the EU law is all the contrary: linking makes no derivatives\nThe footnote on this section is to a FAQ from a German law firm. I read the FAQ. They cite the EUPL info on joinup, and I am guessing that they specifically had this paragraph in mind (<https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/news/understanding-eupl-v12>):\n\n&gt; On the other hand, the European law (in particular recitals 10 and 15 of Directive 2009/24/EC on the protection of computer programs) seems to invalidate the idea of “strong copyleft” in the case of linking. According those provisions, any portion of code that is strictly necessary for implementing interoperability can be reproduced without copyright infringement. This means that linking cannot be submitted to conditions or restricted by a so-called “strong copyleft licence”. As a consequence, linking two programs does not produce a single derivative of both (each program code stay covered by its primary licence). Therefore the question is answered by the Directive: the EUPL v1.2 is copyleft (or share-alike) for protecting the covered software only from exclusive appropriation, but it has no pretention for any “viral extension” to other software in case of linking.\nNotice the hedge phrase \"seems to invalidate.\" I think this wording indicates that there is no legal precedent or case law that confirms/reinforces the legal view that the EC is espousing. It explains the careful wording that the German lawyers used when describing the issue (<https://www.ra-plutte.de/open-source-software-recht-grosse-faq-tipps>; translation from Google): \"This is also a copyleft license... Nevertheless, the Commission believes that the viral effect does not apply to links ( or to static ) from other programs if they are used for the purpose of interoperability. The Commission is therefore placing the EUPL in a new category of „ Interoperable Copyleft “-Licenses.\" Again, notice the hedge phrase \"the Commission believes\" rather than a flat statement of fact.\n\nI did a web search for case law and legal precedent that would clarify the legal treatment of \"derivative works\" under the EUPL in the EU, and I could not find anything -- not an encouraging sign. Perhaps a lawyer would have more success. However, I did find this presentation from a German lawyer that seems relevant:  <http://faif.us/cast-media/FaiF_0x39_FOSDEM-2013_EU-Derivative-Work_slides.pdf>. According to him, the definition is not clear, and he concludes with a note that \"Decisions of courts are unforseeable.\" The presentation predates EUPL 1.2 -- but I think it doesn't predate the section of EC law that joinup cites when it gives its opinion that linking doesn't create derivation.\n\nMy takeaway from this is that there is *probably* good reason to believe that linking to an EUPL license doesn't create a derivative work under EU law. But as the German lawyer says in the slide deck I just cited, the meaning of \"derivative work\" is *definitely* unclear/different outside the EU. So even if the answer to my \"is it legal to build a non-copyleft app\" question is a pretty strong yes in the EU, an EUPL license pretty clearly doesn't guarantee that in the United States, Canada, Mexico, India, Argentina, Japan, South Africa, etc.\n\nI am not a lawyer, and I don't claim to have deep insight into legalities. However, I do think that the kind of analysis I've done here will meet or exceed the analysis done by many engineers and business people who ask whether their product can consume keriox/cesrox.

There are things that MPL, MIT, or Apache 2 make sense for.\n\nGiven all of the arguments expressed here it seems that KERI and ACDC and attendant libraries make the most sense to release under Apache 2 given that they are protocols first, software second and that we are going for the lowest bar of entry."}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"b93afcd23af8","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2023-05-24/5315833935091_b93afcd23af8e5c45914_72.jpg","first_name":"Kent","real_name":"Kent Bull","display_name":"Kent Bull","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"kent","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false}},{"client_msg_id":"c3cb6511-7e05-4ab7-b57b-267112687f54","type":"message","text":"<@U013F46SDRR> and <@U02N7K951DW> I regret to leave the four freedoms behind at least a little.

HCF is early adopter and implementer of keri ecosystem components. From day one HCF togheter with  Jolocom and Argonauths build first rust implementation of keri components (including cesrox). After realizing risks related with the licensing we decided to change license from Apache to EUPL to protect community, donating in the same time implementation which we did on Apache2.0 to WebOfTrust repo as previously it was developed under DIF. Observing activities within our community I realized that few people would like to reactivate rust implementation of KERI under Apache2.0, I was happy to see that finally people notice values of multi-target source code which definitely would   help with adoption. We were working on those project since 2020 and had already plans to extract components of `cesrox`, `said` and `teilox` as separate crates, I took immediate decision to secure the namespace. If it was fair or not you would judge. Both as HCF and MeDDEa we invested quite number of resources and money in development of those libraries even that is very early we already have some customers who are starting using them. We continue investing and committing for sustainable development and support  of this community and rust implementation of keri components in the future.\nBecause of the mistake I created both namespaces on <http://crates.io|crates.io> `cesr` and `cesrox` - `cesr` is not used since following the naming convention the intention was to name create as the git repository for marketing purposes. Unfortunately there is no way to remove namespace on <http://crate.io|crate.io>. We do not control or own `keri` namespace as it was stated in the first comment by <@U024KC347B4>, this belongs to DIF (or at least members of the DIF group) we do not intent to use or have neither `keri` nor `keriox` namespace at <http://crates.io|crates.io> since those would not be libraries and does not make sense to distribute them through <http://crates.io|crates.io>.\n\nAnswering the question:\n1. I would vote against moving `cesrox` namespace due to practical reasons. There is some hassle for community which is already using `cesrox` and would generate confusion on <http://crates.io|crates.io> directly due to change of license.\n2. I am aware of that issue and I see that this could not look very good and could generate questions about licensing of the whole crate if it consist of some EUPL code.\n3. Since `cesr` namespace was allocated as well with EUPL would generate same problem but would not make any addition effort for those who already using `cesrox` I would suggest to pick any available namespace and create it from scratch to avoid problems in the future.\nI would like to add that neither personally nor as representative of HCF and MeDDEa I am not against Apache2.0 implementation and I am happy to see others contributions and their choices. Releasing the namespace on crates is as well not a problem although I think it won't be fair on front of all those developers who worked almost 2 years on those projects just to take it without solid reason. If the community would vote in favor of that transition I would be happy to assist and help to do the transfer. It is just a name and we still relatively early with adoption that won't cause negative impact. I just hope that after that transition, commitment of those who vote in favor would make sure to keep this package in healthy state as we would do it.","user":"U013F46SDRR","ts":"1671367261.133949","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"5c6KU","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I am Head of Technology Council at Human Colossus Foundation, and CTO at MeDDEa Solutions.
