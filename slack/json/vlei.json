Join a Video Call with all other GARs.\n2. Send your OOBI over video call.\n3. Receive OOBIs over video call.\n4. Send challenge message to others.\n5. Receive challenge messages.\n6. Configure and join the multisig group.\n\nAll members must complete the first 5 steps as described below. Once that has been completed, one member of the group must  \nbe selected as the Lead. The Lead is responsible for running the Group Multisig Shell to generate the configuration file  \nfor the group multisig AID and initiate the inception with that configuration file. All other members will join the multisig  \ngroup once they receive the notification from the Lead. The rest of this document describes the entire process.\n\n*Join Video Call*\n\nThe vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework (vLEI EGF) mandates that all participants in the QVI AIDs must perform NIST-800-63-3 IAL-2 identity  \nassurance with all other participants in their group multisig. In addition, once that is complete the members are required to join  \na live video call with all other participants and present Out-of-band Introductions (OOBIs) and exchange signed challenge messages in the  \nsame live session to satisfy the 2-factor identity authentication requirements. The video sessions can be one-to-one video calls  \nbetween each participant-pair or one video call with all participants in the same session. It is important during the video call to follow  \nthe steps defined in the rest of this document to ensure proper compliance with the identity authentication requirements of the vLEI EGF.\n\n*Send and Receive OOBIs*\n\nEach participant in the group multisig must generate an OOBI and paste their OOBI in the video call chat for all other participants  \nto resolve. To generate an OOBI for your local AID, run the following script:\n\n```\n$ ./scripts/generate-oobi.sh\n```\n\nThis script will use your local AID by default and generate all \"witness OOBIs\" that are valid for that AID. The output should  \nlook similar to the following (except for AID values and IP addresses):\n\n```\n<http://49.12.190.139:5623/oobi/EHlegxGzgOsBLZQZJSUQW-vKwgeOo8YPcNMJIgTJO82Q/witness/BILZrnru0e-0MUmnnjOdWTrZ7OW3sCuk_C_67uYeLsN_>\n<http://139.99.193.43:5623/oobi/EHlegxGzgOsBLZQZJSUQW-vKwgeOo8YPcNMJIgTJO82Q/witness/BN6TBUuiDY_m87govmYhQ2ryYP2opJROqjDkZToxuxS2>\n<http://20.3.144.86:5623/oobi/EHlegxGzgOsBLZQZJSUQW-vKwgeOo8YPcNMJIgTJO82Q/witness/BBD748wGFn9-1nfVEtfwd97wc-HCw0LRF2xeIujmqJOQ>\n<http://13.245.160.59:5623/oobi/EHlegxGzgOsBLZQZJSUQW-vKwgeOo8YPcNMJIgTJO82Q/witness/BHeD7WvSDGwm0glBHGTuHpGeMRq7HyCOAJ8h_epQyHkR>\n<http://47.242.47.124:5623/oobi/EHlegxGzgOsBLZQZJSUQW-vKwgeOo8YPcNMJIgTJO82Q/witness/BBHjAqI2Bf_L6BtR0ueAGf12GXEKKCPo2etRCjuu87U7>\n```\n\nCopy any one (and only one) of the URLs displayed in the output and paste it into the chat window of the live video session. For  \neach of the other participants in your group multisig, you will need to resolve their OOBI that they have pasted into the video  \nchat and assign them a local alias that you will use to refer to them in your local QAR environment.\n\nFor each participant, copy their URL from the video chat and run the following command:\n\n```\n$ ./scripts/resolve-oobi.sh\n```\n\nFirst, this script will prompt you for URL of the OOBI you wish to resolve (ensure this is not your own URL):\n\n```\nType or paste OOBI URL:\n```\n\nAfter you paste your OOBI the script will prompt you to enter an Alias for this OOBI. This alias will be your local \"nickname\"  \nfor the AID that is resolved from the OOBI. It is local to you and not shared so you should use a name that will uniquely  \nidentify the controller of the AID to you. Once to type the alias and hit enter the system should indicate that the OOBI  \nwas resolve and show you the Alias and AID that was just created in your datastore.\n\n```\nType or paste OOBI URL: <http://20.3.144.86:5623/oobi/EHlegxGzgOsBLZQZJSUQW-vKwgeOo8YPcNMJIgTJO82Q/witness/BBD748wGFn9-1nfVEtfwd97wc-HCw0LRF2xeIujmqJOQ>\nEnter an Alias for the AID: John Doe\n\n<http://20.3.144.86:5623/oobi/EHlegxGzgOsBLZQZJSUQW-vKwgeOo8YPcNMJIgTJO82Q/witness/BBD748wGFn9-1nfVEtfwd97wc-HCw0LRF2xeIujmqJOQ> resolved\n\nAlias: John Doe\nAID:   EHlegxGzgOsBLZQZJSUQW-vKwgeOo8YPcNMJIgTJO82Q\n```\n\nYou must perform this step with each other participant in your group to retrieve their key event log for their AID and  \nassociate an Alias with their AID. When this is complete you'll have a local \"contact\" entry for each other participant and while  \nstill on the save live video session you can move on to the next step to authenticate these contacts.\n\n*Send and Receive Challenge Messages*\n\nIn the same live session as the OOBI exchange, participants must challenge each other participant with a 12-word challenge  \nphase that the other participant must sign and return. This ensures that the other participants in the group are the  \nsole controller of the private key of the AID resolved during the OOBI exchange protocol.\n\nTo challenge all the other participants in your group, you must generate a random challenge phrase using the  \nfollowing command and paste it in a PRIVATE chat with the other participant. The script will prompt you for the Alias  \nof the other participant you are challenging and display the 12-word phrase. The script will then wait for the other  \nparticipant to use their system to sign the phrase (described below) and return it to you using a KERI peer-to-peer  \nprotocol message. Once you have recieved a valid signed challenge response containing the 12-word phrase from the other  \nparticipant.\n\n*Note:*\n\n* * *\n\n_You should orchestrate in what order each member of the group challenges, while the rest respond. Then the next member challenges, and everyone else responds in turn._\n\n_There should only be one member of the group running `generate-challenge.sh` at once._\n\n* * *\n\n```\n$ ./scripts/generate-challenge.sh\n```\n\nThe script will prompt you for the Alias, display the unique 12-word challenge for this participant and indicate that it  \nis waiting for a valid response (the 12-word phase will be different every time).\n\n```\n$ ./scripts/generate-challenge.sh\nEnter the Alias to whom you will send the words: John Doe\nrice jewel into dance bean stadium west sister auto cupboard repair daughter\nChecking mailboxes for any challenge responses...\n```\n\nYou need to copy the second line from the output and paste it in a private chat to the participant you indicated with  \nthe Alias you typed. Once that participant signs the response this script will authenticate the contact in your database  \nand display the authenticated contact information. You must verbally tell the other participant that you received a successful  \nsigned response to your challenge:\n\n```\nSigner John Doe successfully responded to challenge words: [\"rice\", \"jewel\", \"into\", \"dance\", \"bean\", \"stadium\", \"west\", \"sister\", \"auto\", \"cupboard\", \"repair\", \"daughter\"]\n```\n\nDuring this process you will also be challenged with unique 12-word challenges that you must sign and return to the  \noriginator or the challenge. When you receive a 12-word challenge from another participant you must sign it and return  \nthat signed response to the other participant using the following command:\n\n```\n$ ./scripts/respond-to-challenge.sh\n```\n\nThis script is similar to the script used to resolve an OOBI earlier. It will first prompt you to type or paste the 12-word  \nchallenge and then it will ask for the Alias of the AID who sent you challenge:\n\n```\n./scripts/respond-to-challenge.sh\nType or paste challenge sent to you: rice jewel into dance bean stadium west sister auto cupboard repair daughter\nEnter the Alias who sent you the words: John Doe\nChallenge phrase signed and sent\n```\n\nThis will sign the 12-word challenge using the private key of your local AID an…","title":"<https://github.com/GLEIF-IT/vlei-qvi/blob/main/docs/creating-group-aid.md | creating-group-aid.md>","footer":"<https://github.com/GLEIF-IT/vlei-qvi|GLEIF-IT/vlei-qvi>","mrkdwn_in":["text"]}]},{"client_msg_id":"93AD60BF-538C-4AF5-899C-4BD0882FE70C","type":"message","text":"I’ll review the documentation and reply in the morning ","user":"U024CJMG22J","ts":"1683688795.865379","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"=eykp","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"I’ll"},{"type":"text","text":" review the documentation and reply in the morning "}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"g606bec523fd","image_72":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/606bec523fdd8d67313b404c09d5ae1f.jpg?s=72&d=https%3A%2F%2Fa.slack-edge.com%2Fdf10d%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fava_0011-72.png","first_name":"","real_name":"Phil Feairheller","display_name":"","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"pfeairheller","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false}},{"client_msg_id":"155265C9-3380-44DB-84ED-60CD00C84FB7","type":"message","text":"KIMS has a `delegator` command for adding a delegator.

But here is my take.\n\nKERI is specifically designed to be a key management infrastructure for identity systems. Once you have KERI as a foundational layer, you can build any application on top of that. You can certainly build a KERI-based financial application where signatures on transactions are verified using the KERI protocol.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that KERI is not ‘double-spending proof’ so you cannot build something like Bitcoin using KERI by itself.

Once you have KERI as a foundational layer, you can build any application on top of that. You can certainly build a KERI-based financial application where signatures on transactions are verified using the KERI protocol.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that KERI is not ‘double-spending proof’ so you cannot build something like Bitcoin using KERI by itself.
