creation tool\n• Mark Down Editor\n• Version control (git, Github or Gitlab)\n\n*Steps*\n*Demand*\n\nA certain resource needs to be subtitled, explained further, etc. Be sure it has the added value you think it has. Ask around. Because there'll a hugh effort involved to:\n\n• transcribe the resource\n• correct the subtitles by listening carefully what's been said by whom\n• connect the resource to the glossary\n• create new glossary items and amend existing ones (to avoid confusion when a term in a different context means something else)\n• create an index of terms used in the resource into the video (timing) and into the glossary\n• document the resource properly and take into production after testing.\n\nAn hour of footage can take days to decipher and document. Again, be sure it's worth it.\n\n*Use Youtube to subtitle the resource*\n\nUpload the video to Youtube. Choose the right confidentiality and Youtube will start to create subtitles automatically. _Download_ the subtitle-file to your local machine once it's ready: a `.sbv` file.\n\n*Edit subtitles*\n\nAs you edit, also have a an Excel sheet open with a few columns:\n\n• term\n• text\n• level\n• link\n• vidstart\n\n*Term*s are words used by the speakers in the resource, you can provide a *link* to more explanation, mainly to the <https://github.com/trustoverip/acdc/wiki/|ACDC glossary>. The point in the video where a speaker _mentions the term for the first time_ is called *vidstart*, you can copy this data from from the .sbv subtitle file downloaded from Youtube. the *level* of understanding at which this term might need explanation, and finally a _brief explanation_ in field *text* of the term in the first column.\n\n*Tools and techniques*\n\nThere are lots of tips and tools on the web you can find to edit your Youtube subtitles / captions.

A sheet of terms is very practical:\n\n• lots of software available to amend and manage sheets\n• many people have the skills to manage sheets with this software\n• a sheet can enforce a notion of a unique value ('Key') in a column, a meaningless long-living identifier\n• sheets can be flexibly expanded so that the content gets richer: tags, categories, dictionaries, etc\n• sheet can be exported to comma separated files (CSVs)\n• CSVs can be imported into markdown, front matter, yaml files, etc.\n\nThe reason it's called 'Terms WOT manage':\n\n1. it's the management tool our unique identifier\n2. it covers all the Concepts, terms, categories, dictionaries, tags in the WebofTrust (WOT) field.\n3. The smallest unit of declaration is a 'Term'\n\n*Conventions*\n\nColumns are our fields. Field names are in the first row. A few columns maintain database structure:\n\n• Key: a unique incremental meaningless numeric identifier. The uniqueness is not enforced by code, but by userinterface: conditional formatting colours the cells with the same value red.\n• TTTTT_FKey: this columns contains foreigns key into another table or sheet. TTTTT can be a file that has terms mentioned in a video (\"PhilVid\") or another Glossary (\"eSSIF-lab\") that are related to the matching term on a specific row in our sheet.\n• Cat_CCCCC: this columns contains Categories. We consider a term from a certain category went it's mentioned regularly in the content of certain repository (e.g. 'KERI' or 'OOBI') of the WebofTrust Github site.\n\nOne term per row. We give *an extra row to the abbreviation* of a term. The reason fot this is a ToIP convention:\n\n• the term is lowercase and has '-' between the words of the term, e.g. 'key-event-log'\n• the abbreviation is uppercase and can have a hyphen, e.g. 'VC-TEL'\n• the term always has a corresponding .md file in the ToIP Glossary, its .md file has a '## Definition' header\n• the abbreviation (if relevant, which is a subjective guess by the team) also has a corresponding .md file in the ToIP Glossary, its .md file ONLY has a *'## See' header*. The 'See' contains a link to the matching term.\n\nKEL.md:\n\n```\n## See \n[Key event log](key-event-log)\n```\n\nkey-event-log.md:\n\n```\n## Definition\nA verifiable data structure that is a backward and forward chained ...\n```\n\n*Counting tool*\n\nThe counting tool is offered by <http://Blockchainbird.org|Blockchainbird.org> and has been develop in 2019 as a means to assess the level of real expertise in blockchain publications. It crawled through a pdf, based on a dictionaries of terms and very simple business rules.\n\n&gt; E.g. If a pdf mentions 'bitcoin' in conjunction with words like 'scam', 'tax evasion', etc. we considered the writers as not being informed too well about the true nature of the bitcoin / blockchain innovation.\n\n*Why would we need a terms counting tool?*\n\nThe actual presence of a certain glossary term in documents and webpages is a strong indication whether the term at hand is relevant in a certain section. Based on this relevance expressed in an objective count we can automatically added certain tags and categories to the term.\n\n&gt; The term 'out-of-band' has lots of 'hits' in the OOBI repo, but much less so in the KERI repo.\n\nBased on this relevance expressed in an objective count we can automatically added certain tags and categories to the term.\n\n&gt; The term 'out-of-band' wil have an impressive count in the column `Cat_OOBI`. We might offer a high level menu item for the term in the sidebar of the WebofTrust Glossary 'OOBI'.\n\nThe other reason is that a manual check for terms in documents is a very strenuous and time-consuming effort. And the result is always outdated per definition: once your change the source, the glossary needs to be updated too.\n\n*In short:  \nWe count, so we're lazily up to date.*\n\n*Redesign*\n\nRecently the tool has been engineered towards the WOT-terms challenge:\n\n• it crawls any Github page and also pdfs (if necessary)\n• the tool uses the 'Terms WOT manage' sheet to match terms\n• the scores are based on a combination of parameters:\n    1. level of (understanding need for) the term\n    2. number of appearances, the actual count\n\n*Results*\n\nThe count of terms are in the Cat_CCCCC columns after a (re)run of the counting tool\n\n*Why do we need this?*\n\n• Key: We need a Key field to be able to have a unique long-living identifier for a term in the WebofTrust domain.\n• TTTTT_Fkey / TTTTT_start: We use this Foreign Key to link to other educational resources of the this term, like Youtube footage*, webpages and other glossaries.\n• level: We assess a &lt;../README.md#levels-of-understanding|level of understanding&gt; to meaningful study a term. Regardless this subjective and personal judgement, the filtering options are numerous:\n\n1. offer everything (a glossary)\n2. offer a learning trajectory\n3. filter in the opposite direction: exclude terms for experts\n4. etc.\n\n• Cat_CCCCC: we are now able to store the <https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/blob/gh-pages/howto/why-terms-wot-manage-structure.md#counting-tool|counts> and then offer the term in various relevant contect at the front end of the site.\n\n'* Youtube footage*: plus the start time of where the term is mentioned first or most extensively.\n\n*Why not a term content file per level of understanding?*\n\nPer term various levels of explanation (plus related further readings) are offered within one source file `.md`. The reason for this is that every individual learner is different. Within the source file of a term we can label \"stars\" to both questions and answers, compliant to what's explained in this section of the README.md file : &lt;../README.md#levels-of-understanding|Levels of Understanding&gt;\n\nBy offering \"everything we have\" about a certain term in one file a reader is able to identify herself / himself with a certain level in a specific context and \"filter the stars\" in an eye blink.\n\n*What's the whole point of managing WOT term in a sheet?*\n\nThree major applications:\n\nBeing the home of our terms maintenance, we &lt;./load-toip-glossary-in-weboftrust-github-page.md|load ToIP glossary&gt; and generate our Jekyll <https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/|static content site> on Github. This whole process is steered with the content in the Terms WOT manage sheet.\n\nAny resource that mentions WebofTrust terms can be much easier enriched with the use of  \nE.g. we can create a <https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/blob/gh-pages/howto/create-terms-link-table.md|terms link table for any footage> from the sheet Terms WOT manage sheet.\n\nIntegration and synchronisation with other glossaries and destination information sources is possible by maintenance of Key and Foreign Keys in Terms WOT manage sheet.\n\nThis is a non-exhaustive list of application options.","title":"<https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/blob/gh-pages/howto/why-terms-wot-manage-structure.md | why-terms-wot-manage-structure.md>","footer":"<https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms|WebOfTrust/WOT-terms>","mrkdwn_in":["text"]}]},{"client_msg_id":"51CB3140-09B0-4059-98FF-4D655BDCFC55","type":"message","text":"It would be cool to have a way to vote on different definitions as well as see their source and supporters.","user":"U03EUG009MY","ts":"1660842465.794229","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"K1S2","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"It would be cool to have a way to vote on different definitions as well as see their source and supporters."}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"b93afcd23af8","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2023-05-24/5315833935091_b93afcd23af8e5c45914_72.jpg","first_name":"Kent","real_name":"Kent Bull","display_name":"Kent Bull","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"kent","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false}},{"client_msg_id":"1404a870-7eae-4967-9359-e2395f834764","type":"message","text":"I’ve started  with a commenting tool <http://commento.io|commento.io>; I pay for them, in return they’re not selling our data :wink: like disqus does.

think are in the second group of KERI suite developers; real developers who came just after the leading group (Sam, Philip and Kevin).\nWhy? Because that’s the group we aim our Edu site at, to start with.\nIf I, by mistake, considered you in this group and that’s not correct, just forget about the PM.\nIf I, by mistake, considered you out of this group and that’s not correct, just drop me a line and I will correct my error.\nWhy do target this group with the site? Because they’ve just experienced what it’s like to have to find your way through the code and concepts. We think there will be more developers trying to deep dive into KERI soon. We want to give them the gift of your experience and our work on the Edu site.\n\nThis is the letter:\n\nHey &lt;recipient&gt;,\n\nI wanted to reach out and give you an update on the exciting progress we’ve made with our site, the “KERI suite search engine (<https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/?level=3|KERISSE>): Personal learning environment and consensus building with others.” As someone with exceptional technical skills, your expertise and input are incredibly valuable in shaping the design of KERI / ACDC but could also be of great value for functionality of the KERI suite search engine (KERISSE).\nBefore we delve into the specifics, I wanted to share an important piece of advice we received from Rieks Joosten (eSSIF-lab) regarding our development approach of KERISSE. Rieks emphasized the significance of pausing and reflecting before diving headfirst into new activities. Instead of rushing into implementation, it’s crucial for us to take a step back and consider the results we want to achieve, identify our target users, and determine what they should be able to accomplish with the platform. This thoughtful approach will help us avoid potential roadblocks and ensure a streamlined development process.\nWith that in mind, I would love to hear your insights on the following design considerations for the KERI suite search engine:\n\n1. What is the result of this platform?\nThe platform aims to serve as a comprehensive collection of relevant resources where consensus can be achieved regarding the meaning of specific terms, but only in the context of the full KERI suite. Our goal is to facilitate a high level of understanding among our target group, with a minimum output level of 7 (or ‘111’).\n 2\tWho is going to use this platform?\nWe are targeting Technical Self-Sovereign Identity experts who possess both development skills and fundamental knowledge in the areas of cryptography, SSI, and governance. The intended users should have a minimum input level of understanding of 3 (or ‘011’).\n3\tWhat should users be able to do with the platform?\nUsers should have confidence in the completeness and timeliness of the resource-scraping process that powers the platform. Additionally, we aim to provide a glossary service at various levels of understanding, enabling users to achieve consensus and share their search results with others for effective communication. Moreover, we want to offer users the opportunity to delve into the historical concepts and choices underlying all KERI parts, enabling a deeper comprehension of the “Why” behind the suite. Lastly, we aim to enhance the visibility and dynamic questioning of code structure in various programming languages, similar to the capabilities found in Rust.\n\nTo summarize:\n• What is this platform?\nThe KERI suite search engine (KERISSE) and a personal learning environment for consensus building with others.\n• Who is going to use this platform?\nTechnical Self-Sovereign Identity experts who are developers as well, while also welcoming guest users starting at level 1 (or ‘001’).\n• What can users do with this platform that they can’t do with anything else?\nUnlike other platforms, ours incorporates intelligent features such as resource selection, labeling, categorization, and ranking. By combining these capabilities with scraping, indexing, and a customized search engine, we provide manageable and appropriately ranked search results. Users can also utilize tailor-made filters in the left menu of KERISSE to access these results. Presently, neither Github, Google, nor existing AI systems can deliver this level of content.\nWe would be thrilled to hear your thoughts and suggestions regarding the design and functionality we’ve outlined above.\nYou could this straight into the source or comments to the source in HackMD <https://hackmd.io/2C8ch1meS6ad3F3g2aEewg?both#Text-%E2%80%9CDon%E2%80%99t-make-me-think%E2%80%9D|here (click this link)>.\n\nYour input holds immense value in shaping the KERI suite search engine and ensuring its efficacy as a valuable resource for our target users of which, we image, you could be one. Your technical expertise and unique perspective are indispensable and will undoubtedly contribute to the success of this endeavor.\nThank you for taking the time to consider our request.

Rather, I aim to gain a solid understanding of KERI’s inner workings so that I can communicate effectively with my developer colleagues and make well-informed business decisions.  \nAny advice or guidance would be appreciated!","title":"Comment on #30 Report of current responses","title_link":"https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/discussions/30#discussioncomment-6381867","footer":"<https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms|WebOfTrust/WOT-terms>","mrkdwn_in":["text"]}]},{"bot_id":"B024STY9HQT","type":"message","text":"","user":"U025GFV1SJC","ts":"1688719414.083719","app_id":"A01BP7R4KNY","team":"T0137GA6B7G","bot_profile":{"id":"B024STY9HQT","app_id":"A01BP7R4KNY","name":"GitHub","icons":{"image_36":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2020-11-25/1527503386626_319578f21381f9641cd8_36.png","image_48":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2020-11-25/1527503386626_319578f21381f9641cd8_48.png","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2020-11-25/1527503386626_319578f21381f9641cd8_72.png"},"deleted":false,"updated":1623418087,"team_id":"T0137GA6B7G"},"attachments":[{"id":1,"footer_icon":"https://slack.github.com/static/img/favicon-neutral.png","color":"24292f","fallback":"[WebOfTrust/WOT-terms] 2 new commits pushed to _main_ by henkvancann","text":"`<https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/commit/f2583289bde57466697feedc06045d5ec514b888|f2583289>` -

This are the results so far. We've asked permission to spread the responses that we've got.\n\nThese were the main questions / topics to address:\n\n*What is the result of this, who is going to use this and what should they be able to do with it?*\n*What is the result of this?*\n\nA site as a collection of relevant resources where consensus is achieved about what the meaning of certain terms are, but only in the context of the full KERI suite*  \nThe output level of understanding of our target group is at least 3. <https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms#levels-of-understanding|Levels explained>.\n\n*Who is going to use this?*\n\nTechnical Self-Sovereign Identity experts who are developers too. So both developer skill as well as having fundamental knowledge in the topics: cryptography, SSI and governance. The input level of understanding of our target group is at least 2.\n\n*What should they be able to do with it?*\n\n1. Trust the completeness and actuality of the resource-scraping behind it.\n2. Glossary service at various levels of understanding, to achieve consensus plus share their (search) results with others for communication purposes.\n3. Learn about the historical concepts and choices behind all KERI parts to better understand the Why's of it all (and not only the What and How)\n4. \"See\" the structure of the code in various programming languages much clearer, the ability to question the structure more dynamically and more visual (like Rust has build in).\n\n'* KERI, ACDC, CESR, OOBI, etc\n\n*What is this?*\n\n*KERI suite search engine (KERISSE)*  \n_Personal learning environment and consensus building with others_\n\n*Who is going to use this?*\n\nSee above and any guest user starting at level 1 ((say starting from \"E-Identity expert\") is welcome too. Laymen might get lost, we'll accept this**, the site is targetted at experts.\n\n'** Trying to educate laymen on SSI and KERI suite terminology introduces a whole next level of complexity (hard-felt experience :) )\n\n*What can he do with it, that he can’t do with anything else?*\n\nAnything else does not have the intelligence built-in that combines proper selection and labelling of resources, categorizations and ranking of resources on one hand and scraping and indexing with a fit-for-purpose customized search engine on the other hand that results in manageabe and properly ranked search results. The results are accessible through tailor-made filters in the left menu of KERISSE.  \nCurrently Github nor Google and even AI can't deliver this content.","title":"#30 Report of current responses","title_link":"https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/discussions/30","footer":"<https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms|WebOfTrust/WOT-terms>","fields":[{"value":"Ideas","title":"Category","short":true},{"value":"11","title":"Comments","short":true}],"mrkdwn_in":["text"]}],"thread_ts":"1692673716.074429","reply_count":1,"reply_users_count":1,"latest_reply":"1692736490.781219","reply_users":["U03EUG009MY"],"replies":[{"user":"U03EUG009MY","ts":"1692736490.781219"}],"is_locked":false,"subscribed":false,"reactions":[{"name":"+1::skin-tone-2","users":["U03EUG009MY"],"count":1}]},{"client_msg_id":"1f90b2a9-7979-494b-835d-a2f11437b885","type":"message","text":"Added <https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/wiki/bran|bran> from this morning’s call.","user":"U03EUG009MY","ts":"1692736446.394779","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"+2Gcg","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"Added "},{"type":"link","url":"https://github.com/WebOfTrust/WOT-terms/wiki/bran","text":"bran"},{"type":"text","text":" from this morning’s call."}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"b93afcd23af8","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2023-05-24/5315833935091_b93afcd23af8e5c45914_72.jpg","first_name":"Kent","real_name":"Kent Bull","display_name":"Kent Bull","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"kent","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false},"thread_ts":"1692736446.394779","reply_count":1,"reply_users_count":1,"latest_reply":"1692789375.002069","reply_users":["U04H17ZEX9R"],"replies":[{"user":"U04H17ZEX9R","ts":"1692789375.002069"}],"is_locked":false,"subscribed":false,"reactions":[{"name":"+1","users":["U05H2PS5U6Q","U04H17ZEX9R"],"count":2}]},{"client_msg_id":"2abb91f9-b1ba-4bda-9b40-5dab47d49120","type":"message","text":"just did","user":"U03EUG009MY","ts":"1692736490.781219","blocks":[{"type":"rich_text","block_id":"MtCyN","elements":[{"type":"rich_text_section","elements":[{"type":"text","text":"just did"}]}]}],"team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_team":"T0137GA6B7G","source_team":"T0137GA6B7G","user_profile":{"avatar_hash":"b93afcd23af8","image_72":"https://avatars.slack-edge.com/2023-05-24/5315833935091_b93afcd23af8e5c45914_72.jpg","first_name":"Kent","real_name":"Kent Bull","display_name":"Kent Bull","team":"T0137GA6B7G","name":"kent","is_restricted":false,"is_ultra_restricted":false},"thread_ts":"1692673716.074429","parent_user_id":"U02PA6UQ6BV"},{"client_msg_id":"3884070b-37fc-42d1-b25f-77949987c19e","type":"message","text":"I initially assumed it means “binary random”.
