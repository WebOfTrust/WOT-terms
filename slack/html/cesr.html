                    <div class="msg"><@U02N7K951DW> Somewhat. Most of us are still coming up to speed on the specs and CESR as well as CESR Proof Sigs. Henk and I are the farthest along right now.
I have a few drafts of a KERI+ACDC architecture diagram that will show the purpose and place of CESR visually. One of my TODOs this week is to create that diagram and share it here.

The most notable activity today is that we discussed an approach to creating CESROX which is compiling a list of requirements by listing all of the types we can find and making spreadsheets of all the code tables in the spec and in the existing implementations. Essentially, review current work and make a complete list of work to be done.</div>

I went too broad in my initial take so I’m simplifying and paring it down so we have a meaningful diagram that is the right size for teaching and learning.

I’ll likely have it finished in the next few days.</div>

                    <div class="msg">My personal goal is to have the first alpha version, call it 0.1.0, of CESROX done by IIW 35 so we can present on it there. This includes the following:
1. All known types from KERIPY, the KERI Whitepaper, the following specs represented and supported: IETF KERI, ACDC, IPEX, and PTEL
2. Conversion to and from T, B, and R domains.
3. CESR Proof Signatures supported.
4. All attachment semantics from KERIOX and KERIPY implemented
So far I came across 30 types in the IETF KERI spec. I’m still collecting types from the other listed sources.
This is an ambitious goal. By next week’s CESROX meeting it may have reduced.
As a bare minimum by IIW 35 I want to have at least one cryptographic primitive with attached signatures fully supported in all T, B, and R domains.

The next alpha version, call it 0.2.0, we may target to include features like composability with JSON, CBOR, and MsgPack content.

Tell me what you think, how much you think is doable, and whether you’d like to see a CESROX session at IIW 35, or whether you want to be a part of the presentation!</div>

                    <div class="msg">What i would propose to you is to consider the following exercise:

A library that is able to support any data model and has proper architecture to make it happen. Data model and code tables can be artificial, only for the purpose of having proper tests in CESROX. On top of that, the B,T domains can be implemented.

Having such a library, KERIpy data model is defined by the consumer, so by the KERIpy team at the point of integration. CESROX is opaque to it and does not know it until the integration. Its sole responsibility is to be able to parse CESR streams.</div>

                    <div class="msg">I really like this. All we need to do is to support the following set of pluggable abstractions and behaviors:

*Abstractions*
1. An encoding - JSON, CBOR, MsgPack, CESR)
2. A raw data type - a domain-specific raw data type plugged in at an integration point
3. A code table - a pluggable data type lookup table specifying size, nesting, and other serialization-relevant properties for the specified data type
4. A code table entry - a specific entry of a data type into a type lookup table
5. Raw type mapping - a mapping between a raw data type and a code table entry. Some sort of link between a raw data type in the target language (Rust, Python, Javascript, Clojure) and a selector in code table plugged in to the CESR serialization and deserialization engine. 
*Behaviors*
1. Stream parsing
2. Stream type detection - binary or text - *in starting tritet <https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-cesr/draft-ssmith-cesr.html#name-performant-resynchronizatio|CESR 3.6.1 Performant Resynchronization>* 
3. Stream encoding detection - CBOR, JSON, MsgPack, CESR - *in starting tritet*
4. Code table detection - which code table should be used - *<https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-cesr/draft-ssmith-cesr.html#name-stream-parsing-rules|CESR 3.6.2 Stream Parsing Rules> apply*
5. Code table entry recognition - which entry in which code table should be used - *<https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-cesr/draft-ssmith-cesr.html#name-count-group-or-framing-code|CESR .4 Count, Group, for Framing Codes>* apply
6. Data type detection - Based on the supplied raw type mapping of raw type to selector. 
7. Data type serialization - one of the two main workhorse functions
8. Data type deserialization - the other of the two main workhorse functions</div>

                    <div class="msg">While I applaud your enthusiasm, I’d like to provide the following critique. This type of high level architecture and design is likely not appropriate for a low level open source library of a published protocol with one reference implementation in python and another implementation in the target language of this library. Remember, in open source projects… code wins.
I’d like to suggest an alternate approach. It you really want to bootstrap this project, I’d suggest working closely with <@U02N7K951DW>  and see if he can suggest some code from KERIox (he’s already offered) that could be used to get things going in this library. From there, approach <@U013SSREL0H>, <@U024KC347B4> or myself for some pointers into the KERIpy code / tests that would be a good place to initiate a first round of “compatibility tests”.
If you get that working, then we can start talking about IIW presentations and the like.</div>

                    <div class="msg">Hey, sorry for a late response.

We have prepared a code snippet here   <https://hackmd.io/W2Z39cuSSTmD2TovVLvAPg?view#Usage-from-Typescript-example> , how we envision it from the client perspective. Below the snippet, there is a `discussion` with some more explanation of the intent. It makes CESROX agnostic to any data model any client would have. All what matters is to inject code tables that are the source of truth for CESR parsing. As a result client gets `RawMsg[]` that she addresses internally however she wants.

<@U03EUG009MY> <@U024CJMG22J> <@U024KC347B4> take a look and share thoughts.</div>

                    <div class="msg">I must be missing something you are thinking. It seems like making CESRox agnostic to data model is missing the mark. CESR and CESRox should be specific to the data model of KERI and ACDC, should they not be?
I can see an argument for making the ACDC portion of a CESR implementation flexible since there needs to be support for many different credential shapes though it seems the KERI code tables should be very stable and thus I see no need for data-structure agnosticism with regard to KERI. On the contrary, CESR should be tightly coupled and bound to both KERI and ACDC, should it not?</div>

                    <div class="msg">They are actually not... Anything that would require "common" data model, ie. ACDC/KERI specific would come along on top of CESROX. CESROX is purely about parsing streams. Note CESR stream in text mode for JSON is more more or less like this: `{json}attachments{json}attachments...`  . Under `{json}` there is a serialized object, however CESROX doesn't care what it is or whether it is valid according to the rules of client business logic. Therefore the result of parsing by CESROX is: `[RawMsg(payload: json, attachments: [....]), RawMsg(payload: json, attachments: [....]), ...]`. You've got all the attachments that are known from the code tables that you can use further and you've got payload that you map to your data model, ie. a KERI event. You then on the client side check whether signature matches, then validate the event against its schema and so on.

For CESROX all what matters are the code tables, so it can recognize attachments and give them back to you, so you can decide in your business logic what to do with them. That was the reason I proposed an artificial code table and artificial CESR stream (not related to KERI), because it is a good exercise to understand CESR basics.

btw. in KERIOX the module responsible for parsing is here: <https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keriox/tree/master/src/event_parsing></div>

Since they both have an implementation of CESRox then I suspect each of them would gladly become consumers of the CESRox library once it is complete.

The DIF keriox repo is exactly the same other than 11 more recent commits when compared with the WebOfTrust repo. Why development is occurring there rather than in WOT I don’t know. I’m making a pull request today to bring the WOT repo up to date with the DIF repo.</div>

                    <div class="msg">Under DIF license all source code contributions are  apache2. So a pull request from an apache2 licensed repository should not be a problem. Unfortunately, DIF uses a combination of the W3C patent policy and the CC4 license for non-source code contributions and so that is where there is significant ambiguity especially since the W3C Patent Policy as written only provides provisions for management by the w3c not DIF.  In June of 2022 there was a determination by DIF that there were no patentable contribution to the DIF KERI repo for which the W3C patent policy would apply. So any pull requests from code donated to DIF before June of 2022 are clean. Anything after that we should not accept because there is ambiguity as to what is “source code” and what is not when it comes to contributions at DIF. Frankly I consider DIF’s IP policy to be broken because IMHO there is no way to unambiguously determine if a contribution is source code or not. For example is javascript or python code pasted into an issue raised on DIF’s github repo count as source code and falls under apache2? Or is it text and falls under CCby4, or is it a patentable description of a process?  In fact any organization including the W3C that has multiple mutually exclusive split licenses instead of one comprehensive license or licenses instead of a set of comprehensive licenses is IMHO only viable because of the good will of the contributors. There just isn’t enough legal precedent to trust such constructions. By comprehensive I mean all contributions of any and all kinds are covered by one license. One can have multiple comprehensive licenses where a given license takes priority for terms but allows for relaxed terms of use in some circumstance. but all contributions are still covered. So worst case the contribution is no freer than the most restrictive license. Stacking licenses this way is a common legal approach, but splitting is not. Splitting contributions between different licenses is problematic because of the difficulty in defining the boundary. And the worst case is that its not free at all.</div>

                    <div class="msg">One more thing.  All the repos in the WoT project where the KERI code and related standards reside, have a outgoing == incoming policy.This means that someones use (outgoing) of a contribution (incoming) is on the same basis or license. This prevents contributions from being poisoned by other contributions that have a different i.e. more restrictive outgoing license, because once contributed there is no way to separate contributions. It becomes a soup.   It is possible however to have less restrictive outgoing than incoming or have multiple outgoing licenses that are of the same or less level of restriction but with different names because some consumers want to consume (outgoing) under a different license. This is OK as long as its part of the license structure known by contributors.  So for example IETF requires that IETF spec language be contributed under BSD not Apache2. But BSD is no less restrictive than Apache2 for outgoing so it does not poison the apache2 contributions. A consumer can consume under apache2 or via IETF through BSD.</div>

• Create API
    ◦ There is a ticket for this already.
    ◦ It combines API design definition, documentation and implementation.
• Create test vectors
    ◦ Gather the existing test data vectors.
    ◦ Define the minimal needed dataset.
    ◦ Questionable: do we need it at all? As I see by the code it's usually simpler to generate the data programmatically. Does it make sense at all to define it as a fixed database?
• CI
    ◦ It's already configured. Just check and think on possible improvements.
• Release process
    ◦ Auto-build and publish <http://crates.io|crates.io> by new tags?
• Implement missing data primitives
    ◦ Here we need to split it by categories, define the list and create issues.</div>

Is it so?” I would say ‘yes’, CESR gracefully ends the discussion about CBOR vs. JSON because the protocol is able to convey all three (msgpk) and the native CESR format in one go. So Cesrox should be able to handle this, afaik.</div>

No, implementing all three serializations at the start in my opinion is over kill. I'd implement serialization with json, then wait for Sam to finish the CESR event format in keripy, then implement that, then cbor msgpk when someone needs them.</div>

                    <div class="msg"><@U048YRLFKTK>: I agree that the design should imagine it, even if the implementation mostly ignores it. I'd like to go one baby step further, if it seems practical. Perhaps we could implement something *very* simple with both CBOR and MsgPack, just to make sure the design has answered the right questions, and to give future developers a place to plug in a more complete impl. For example, maybe we could just serialize integers and strings. This ability could be turned off with compile-time switches in Rust so it doesn't create dependencies for normal developers who only want JSON serialization.</div>

                    <div class="msg">I will not be able to attend today, GLEIF are working with <@U03RLLP2CR5> et al from provenant to stand up the vLEI.

<@U048YRLFKTK> if you are looking for a place to get started with the API, this is what I would do.

Implement a public API that supports consuming a byte stream, then peeks that bytestream to determine the serialization format (look at the first 3 bytes) and return a result that is just Result&lt;SerializationGeneric, Error&gt; and have it return what type of serialization you sent it.

Then have four test cases, bytestream json, bytestream cbor, bytestream msgpk and bytestream unknown.

This will do a few things:

Establish a starting point for the API.
Get familiar with manipulating byte streams in Rust.
Provide future extension points.
you could then look at creating bindings for other languages Provenant is using which may require cesr in the future
Allow me some breathing room to finish the dual index support required to be compatible with the CESR implementation in keripy.

That'd be a fun, fairly big, chunk of work in my opinion.

I will also push my draft PR for dual index support so I'm not sitting on it.</div>

                    <div class="msg"><@U048YRLFKTK> now thinking about the API - the invocation of cesrox probably wants to be ambivalent to the types in your stream.

So:

cesrox.parse(myByteStream, SomeTypeDefinedInYourLanguage) that then returns

Result&lt;Array&lt;SomeTypeDefinedInYourLanguage&gt;, Error&gt;

cesrox can't know about every type contained in every stream, so that needs to be accounted for</div>

                    <div class="msg">`cesrox.parse(myByteStream, SomeTypeDefinedInYourLanguage)` might be problematic, especially the latter argument, considering the FFI layer in the middle. Note that FFI layers, especially for duck-typed languages, have limitations; therefore, strong typing and working across boundaries with object definitions might be extra problematic. It is usually easier to continue solely with primitives.

Having that in mind imposes a slightly different mental model of working with CESR streams (that consist of payloads and attachments). One option is to enable the client to establish objects of his data model straight from the payload. In such case, CESROX provides everything to the client, except it does not deserialize payload from json/cbor/mgpk. Client does it</div>

                    <div class="msg">This makes sense. So then the responsibility of the CESR library would be to:
1. Frame-based data type detection: detect data types with framing codes specified by the self-framing codes from the master code tables.
2. Offer up the raw, serialized type to the host language and binary for deserialization.
Then the host language would take responsibility for taking the type code read by the CESR library and specifying a type mapping to deserialize the detected data type.

The exception to this would be, as Dmitry and Michal stated, primitives since the type list is small and easy to receive from an underlying library through the FFI.

Does this sound accurate?</div>

Is a CESR stream always decoded from Base64 to raw binary prior to deserialization into the target type? Meaning, is raw binary always the intermediate representation between the Base64 sent over the wire and the target in-memory type in Python or Rust?
And, the natural next question, is deserialization the process of converting the raw, base64-decoded binary bytes into the target type for the host language (Python or Rust)?</div>

                    <div class="msg">So then does this, along with the self-framing nature of each CESR data type, mean CESR could support interleaved text and binary stream segments in a single stream? And if yes, this seems to imply that there would need to be a text or binary encoding detection logic branch in the parser used for each newly encountered type in order to parse it properly from binary or text.
I don’t know if people would use interleaved text and binary, I’m just thinking through CESR to understand edge cases.

Am I misunderstanding the intention or use of framing codes? The <https://weboftrust.github.io/ietf-cesr/draft-ssmith-cesr.html#name-composability|composability> definition in the spec seems to indicate things would be done en-masse, so no interleaved T and B domain support, only one or the other it seems:
&gt; The property enables a stream processor to safely convert en-masse a stream of text primitives to binary for compact transmission that may be safely converted back to text en-masse by a stream processor at the other end for further processing or archival storage.</div>

This is correct and I believe there are also other considerations. I am not sure you need to work on a byte streams, ie. as opposed to work on strings, but for sure avoiding cloning is a wise and reasonable approach. There are not so much options to choose here to avoid it. All with trade-offs. We didn't choose yet which way to go, so either with slices or rawptr's.</div>

                    <div class="msg">One more thought I want to highlight here is the following: basically CESR defines the way to understand json/cbor/mgpk/cesr in a data stream and defines a serialization/deserialization algorithm for supported data primitives. So it's not a CESR's work to understand KERI's message structure. Currently it's a little bit mixed by keriox code.
What I want to do is split it in a way that allow CESR to provide serde compatible methods to deserialize primitives and leave the code defining keri structures inside keri. I.e. to provide the simplicity of `event_parsing::message::signed_message(s: &amp;[u8])` but with configurable list of parsers defined by the app, not the cesrox library.
Any feedback is appreciated.</div>

                    <div class="msg">So, CESR should be able to deserialize json/cbor/mgpk events, but cares little for the message body, it's concerned with extracting the size of the message body from the start of the message, based off the serialization, then proceeding to the attachments which use the code tables to extract the attached signatures etc.

&gt; So it's not CESR's work to understand KERI's message structure.
Correct.

Code tables exist for KERI in the CESR Appendix, and additional code tables could be added for other protocols.</div>

This is unfortunate but I can explain, the initial cesrox repo (and name) was conceived by Phil and I on April 25th, under WebOfTrust (<https://github.com/WebOfTrust/cesrox/commit/9de042ab4d458b2c051bf15e55675ed78b0e3c1d>), and the duplicate repo at THCLab on April 28th (<https://github.com/THCLab/cesrox/commit/87c1893ffb373aba88470d1cccbdeb098c051b74>) under the copyleft free EUPL-1.2 license.

Phil and I then committed our initial contents on November 17th  (<https://github.com/WebOfTrust/cesrox/commit/07da651260f98a02e14fbdbce614937843913603>) based off the work THCLab donated to WebOfTrust/keriox, and subsequently THCLab then continued work on November 23rd (<https://github.com/THCLab/cesrox/commit/2f767dffe4ad07334c26efd5b840cb7deb6e69d8>).

Unfortunately this work by THCLab seems to have registered both <https://crates.io/crates/cesr|cesr>  and <https://crates.io/crates/cesrox|cesrox> in <http://crates.io|crates.io> :crying_cat_face:

Given THCLab currently only registers <https://crates.io/crates/keri|keri> on <http://crates.io|crates.io> and not <https://crates.io/crates/keriox|keriox>, I'd like to ask the communities opinion on humbly asking THCLab to graciously relinquish control of cesrox to the WebOfTrust group :pleading_face:, whom are committed to an Apache2 licensed version of cesrox, and originators of the cesrox name, this allows THCLab to remain consistent in their naming of their libraries with keri and cesr.</div>

We working hard same as you guys and we want to promote work which is developed by all of us. If I remember correctly <@U024KC347B4> you missed our last KERI call where we discussed the differences between licensing strategies. We showed that there is no reason be afraid of EUPL and that we could easily collaborate on one repository without any restrictions. EUPL can be reused same as Apache in any proprietary and non-proprietary software. You can easily link cesrox on EUPL into keripy without any conflicts.
The only difference between Apache and EUPL which is relevant for most is that EUPL protect from "taking and not giving back" or "taking and locking it up" which in Apache case is allowed and completely fine but could bring some risk for the community.</div>

Our components keri and cesrox are already used in many projects and changing the name would generate some extra effort. We would evaluate that on our side and will get back here.

As suggested on the call first I would suggest to see if it make sens to combine forces and work on one project. keriox, cesrox and said is already quite solid implementation in rust. I don't see reason why anyone would like to try to recreate that effort once again without solid argument. I respect if someone would have a wish for it but let's be realistic if we want to gain traction we need to work in synergy and not dividing and forking everything.</div>

HCF is not using KERI crates since it does not make sens to do so. KERI crate is "end product" (binary) is nothing which you would like to use or embed it in any software. Distributing binary via crates is not the best idea anyway.

From HCF side what we care are libraries which are helpful for others to integrate it in their systems:
<https://crates.io/crates/cesrox>
<https://crates.io/crates/said>
<https://crates.io/crates/teliox>

we are not planing to publish keri since keri is final product and would be distributed in different way.

I have had to audit every library imported into multiple projects for anything that is not either Apache2 or MIT and remove them from the project.  The liability of exposure to potential lawsuits is not something any VC wants any part of.  They'd rather take their money somewhere less exposed.

As a result, I will not use or contribute to anything that is not Apache2.  One of the goals for a Rust implementation of CESR is to replace the existing parser in KERIPY with a faster "closer to the metal" parser and since KERIPY will remain Apache2 it will not use anything that is EPUL.  So we need an Apache2 version of cesrox to achieve our goal.

I'm not sure how to make it any clearer.  We are proposing an Apache2 version of CESRox.  If the THCLabs repo will remain EPUL, then we will host one on WebOfTrust that is Apache2.  The only ask here is about the crate name.</div>

Just keep in mind that if we do so, <http://crates.io|crates.io> does not allow to alter the past, means that on this crate you would have old versions under EUPL. I don't think there is a way to change that. Not sure if that won't generate any problems for you guys, having a code under different license which is not compatible with existing one.

&gt; EUPL can be reused same as Apache2
Great. Let’s just use Apache2 then.

I do object to this statement, I feel it disingenuous:
&gt; What I don't like is the pressure which is made on this community to go for Apache2 due to false assumptions

I have not, nor has anyone in this community, put any pressure on anyone, to do anything and I vehemently resent the implication.

We created cesrox, under WebOfTrust on GitHub on the twenty fifth of April this year. We spoke about our intent for cesrox at the keri community meetings. In August of this year Kent took on leadership about bringing the effort to life and created this Slack (thanks Kent), and the creation of a community meeting published on the repo and addressed in the keri community meetings, we have then proceeded to have many meetings for cesrox (thanks again Kent).

In November of this year, we did our bi-annual “let’s hack on something fun at IIW“ and were able to get cesrox off the ground thanks to the code you left with us at keriox under Apache2 in WebOfTrust.

In my opinion that was ample time for someone who was interested in doing the same thing, under a different license to speak up in those community meetings.

I will now give you my honest personal opinion.

I find it extremely coincidental all THCLab efforts coincide with the WebOfTrust efforts, but delayed by a few days, almost like something spurred THCLab to do something, but under their preferred license, fine you are free to do so, but to then say:

&gt; I am not denying you to start another project
Seems a little disingenuous again, as one effort seems to have driven the desire for you to start yours.

I’m not a Rust developer, would I love the support of the team at THCLab, yes absolutely.

Dr Smith has discussed licensing with you ad nauseam in previous keri community meetings, he has made his position clear, and you yours. As Dr Smith is the author, creator and visionary of KERI, ACDC and CESR I find myself predisposed to supporting his decision to publish specifications with the IETF and develop implementations for those specifications under Apache2.

I will continue to attempt to develop cesr, in Rust under the Apache2 license with whomever wants to, I have made no demands of anyone.

I asked the community in my original message if they would support asking THCLab to let us use the cersox name, we had some supportive responses and some not supportive responses.

I have no intention of dragging this out, even though we only have a hand full out of twenty something responses I will recommend at the next cesr(ox) community meeting we discuss a name change moving forward, with whomever wishes to work on it, seems like the path of least resistance.</div>

I provided evidence from my past experience of direct financial impact of using software with copyleft-like license. 

You asked “why two” and I answered that question. To call it a false assumption at this point ignores my answer and is disingenuous. 

You state that EUPL does not expose you to any additional lawsuits than Apache2. But then state that it “goes beyond that and protects code from locking it down”. So there are additional restrictions beyond Apache2.  So then what recourse would someone use to enforce that additional restriction?  Well, legal of course… that’s the whole point. So that is additional exposure to lawsuits. And VCs see it this way, I didn’t make that up.

I agree that the EUPL is a good license with many virtues. However, I disagree with the assertion that "there is no reason to fear EUPL by any means."

The problem is that the decision makers on open source use in most companies are not rational developers who will listen to Robert's impassioned advocacy for EUPL. They are lawyers who don't understand tech very well, and/or executives who understand neither the law NOR the tech very well. When I was at a certain large company in Europe that I won't name, there was a standard posture toward open source: *Thou shalt not use anything with a copyleft provision.* Period. There were no exceptions, and the legal department was very unwilling to entertain requests to change the policy. Getting an exception, if possible at all, would have required intervention by the CEO, who had no understanding of tech and had been told by his lawyers that the company's IP policy was incompatible with copyleft.

When I worked at a large company in the US, the policy was similar, and the overhead was similar.

What I believe will happen, if there exists only a repo with EUPL license on it, is that companies like this will refuse to use/adopt KERI. Not because they have done a wise analysis and come Robert's conclusion that it is fine, but because they are irrationally allergic to it.

If we have two repos -- one with EUPL and one with Apache -- then the Apache one will get all the adoption by companies that have serious gravitas but unenlightened leadership. I fear, that's most of the companies we truly want to adopt. And as Robert points out, that leads to needless duplication of effort.

Therefore, I think the best option is one repo, licensed Apache 2. The second best option is two repos, where the EUPL one is downstream of the Apache one, and all the contributions flow into the Apache one. This would allow companies who are enlightened to use the EUPL license, and allow others to use the Apache license if they need to.

The notion that we need to protect the community from commercial interests who will appropriate KERI and run away with it seems very farfetched to me.</div>

                    <div class="msg">thanks <@U03RLLP2CR5> for joining discussion but  I think your comment goes too much personal. EUPL is not mine license I didn't invented it, I don't need to preach to people how great it is. People does not have to listen what I have to say, There is solid EU law behind that license, was vetted by all EU state members. There are tones of lawyers which can assure you about how it works and what purpose it serve. Human Colossus Community decided to go for it because it promotes our values and protect community from "takers" and risk of losing the code in commercial space.

We chose it because our community (including private companies) investing money into development and we want to make sure that this won't be taken away and lost just because someone would jump with bigger resources.

&gt;  The notion that we need to protect the community from commercial interests who will appropriate KERI and run away with it seems very farfetched to me.
It is way closer then we think. We already had some teasers how it was done in HL with IBM, Amazon taking open source and run SaaS and more.

I don't understand why suddenly everyone is so eager to question EUPL. I understand all the points about yours experience and lawyers etc. But lots of companies uses copyleft source code and are fine with that, and I am not talking just about EU and example of EUPL but GPL and companies like google, samsung, microsoft etc.. Sure they don't like it as they need to give back but still using it.

I worked as well for few companies already, never had that problem what you guys describing. As soon as company is fine with giving back they never question that, only those who don't want to give back makes problems. Maybe you guys were unlucky and picked wrong companies.

&gt;  Therefore, I think the best option is one repo
When there is "the best" we always need to ask the best for whom?

In HCF opinion the best is if we can assure that always everyone gives back. You maybe see that differently which is fine. For sure both ideas can coexist and time will shows which goes better. Companies which are related with HCF already invested lots of money in that development, they want to protect that investment.

My point here was just to educated people, and correct false statement which was made few times that EUPL code cannot be reused easily ergo blocks adoption. That is not true and people should be aware of that. If they have facts they can make informed decision that is all. No idea why suddenly we made a big debate about that.

We are part of that community same as you guys, I believe that you would respect our input same way as we respect yours.</div>

                    <div class="msg">Since that get too long just shortly, did we created cesrox on purpose, sure we did, we knew what is coming and we needed to make sure that we can secure our plans without knowing what would be the result of the Apache repo. I knew that this would come sooner or later. As you mentioned we started developing rust implementation. In half way through we realized that we need to protect our work slightly better then what was at DIF. We transition to EUPL and we continue developing, donating what was done so far to WebOfTrust since DIF was not interesting to do anything with it. We worked hard to get to the point were we are, we were preparing release of cesorx for some time due the plans of clean separation of components. We can debate who was first, sure but that does not lead anywhere, we had same rights to claim that namespace as anybody else.

As I said if we decide as community that for whatever reason cesrox namespace on <http://crates.io|crates.io> is better for Apache project then EUPL fine we won't battle. But keep in mind that history on <http://crates.io|crates.io> stays with old license as it is, I don't think that we have practical way to erase it due to that I would say that it would be easier to rename repo on weboftrust github. But if that is no problem let's vote and close that chapter if that somehow helps anybody.</div>

                    <div class="msg"><@U013F46SDRR>: I have two basic questions:

&gt; 1. Is it your intent that consumers of the THC cesrox/keriox repos should be forced to license their applications (codebases that reside in other repos, and that consume cesrox/keriox functionality through its interfaces) under a compatible copyleft license?
I am hoping that you will say, "No -- only that any changes to cesrox/keriox itself must retain the EUPL or a compatible license. A derivative work is something that mixes or changes the source code of the work in question, not something that consumes the source code across an interface boundary."

That would be a happy answer.

If, instead, the answer is yes, then I can't consume your code and still honor your intentions, because I intend that some parts of my company's stack -- not the low-level parts, but certainly higher parts that still consume keri-and-cesr-in-rust -- have licenses that are not copyleft. I think many community members have a similar view.

Assuming your intent about copyleft is narrow, this leads me to question 2:

&gt; 2. Is it actually legal for a company to build an application atop an EUPL-licensed library without being forced to license the whole application with a copyleft license?
If the answer to this question is "clearly yes", then I don't think the EUPL is an adoption problem, and I will happily vote for the whole community to get behind the THC codebase. I will be a strong ally for you. But if the answer is anything less strong -- "probably yes" or "maybe yes" or "no," then I believe there is a major adoption problem, despite your intentions, because legal caution and/or FUD will trump rational analysis.

Unfortunately, my analysis leads me to believe the answer to question 2 is "probably yes" in the EU and "maybe yes" in other parts of the world. Please review my analysis and correct it if needed; I would love to be wrong.

The wikipedia article about EUPL has a section about strong copyleft. That section has the following encouraging quote:

&gt; According to the GPL/AGPL licensor vision, this means some restrictions and conditions regarding interoperability (due to the theory that linking other software with the covered code creates a combined derivative) and regarding compatibility (since no derivative could be licensed under another license, which may create incompatibilities). The EUPL vision that is depending on the EU law is all the contrary: linking makes no derivatives
The footnote on this section is to a FAQ from a German law firm. I read the FAQ. They cite the EUPL info on joinup, and I am guessing that they specifically had this paragraph in mind (<https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/news/understanding-eupl-v12>):

&gt; On the other hand, the European law (in particular recitals 10 and 15 of Directive 2009/24/EC on the protection of computer programs) seems to invalidate the idea of “strong copyleft” in the case of linking. According those provisions, any portion of code that is strictly necessary for implementing interoperability can be reproduced without copyright infringement. This means that linking cannot be submitted to conditions or restricted by a so-called “strong copyleft licence”. As a consequence, linking two programs does not produce a single derivative of both (each program code stay covered by its primary licence). Therefore the question is answered by the Directive: the EUPL v1.2 is copyleft (or share-alike) for protecting the covered software only from exclusive appropriation, but it has no pretention for any “viral extension” to other software in case of linking.
Notice the hedge phrase "seems to invalidate." I think this wording indicates that there is no legal precedent or case law that confirms/reinforces the legal view that the EC is espousing. It explains the careful wording that the German lawyers used when describing the issue (<https://www.ra-plutte.de/open-source-software-recht-grosse-faq-tipps>; translation from Google): "This is also a copyleft license... Nevertheless, the Commission believes that the viral effect does not apply to links ( or to static ) from other programs if they are used for the purpose of interoperability. The Commission is therefore placing the EUPL in a new category of „ Interoperable Copyleft “-Licenses." Again, notice the hedge phrase "the Commission believes" rather than a flat statement of fact.

I did a web search for case law and legal precedent that would clarify the legal treatment of "derivative works" under the EUPL in the EU, and I could not find anything -- not an encouraging sign. Perhaps a lawyer would have more success. However, I did find this presentation from a German lawyer that seems relevant:  <http://faif.us/cast-media/FaiF_0x39_FOSDEM-2013_EU-Derivative-Work_slides.pdf>. According to him, the definition is not clear, and he concludes with a note that "Decisions of courts are unforseeable." The presentation predates EUPL 1.2 -- but I think it doesn't predate the section of EC law that joinup cites when it gives its opinion that linking doesn't create derivation.

My takeaway from this is that there is *probably* good reason to believe that linking to an EUPL license doesn't create a derivative work under EU law. But as the German lawyer says in the slide deck I just cited, the meaning of "derivative work" is *definitely* unclear/different outside the EU. So even if the answer to my "is it legal to build a non-copyleft app" question is a pretty strong yes in the EU, an EUPL license pretty clearly doesn't guarantee that in the United States, Canada, Mexico, India, Argentina, Japan, South Africa, etc.

I am not a lawyer, and I don't claim to have deep insight into legalities. However, I do think that the kind of analysis I've done here will meet or exceed the analysis done by many engineers and business people who ask whether their product can consume keriox/cesrox. If I can't lay my concerns to rest in an hour of thoughtful analysis, I don't think they will be able to, either.

Please, please, teach me what I'm missing so I can lay this concern to rest!</div>

                    <div class="msg">Regarding your concerns about "linking", you are to the point. EUPL within EU law framework backs statement (according to the provision of European Law (Directive EC 2009/24 recitals 10 &amp; 15) that EUPL allows for linking without forcing you to adopt same license. Best source which I can point you right now is this: <https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/news/why-eupl-not-viral-l>
To avoid confusion for those who are not law savvy or had lawyer in a backyard, we clearly stated that on every our repo:  <https://github.com/THCLab/licensing> (each repo link to it for simplicity). Yes you can link it without adopting license for your product. We are just asking if you change something share it back. I think everyone would agree that this is fair deal.

There is very important aspect which many does not think about, which is under which legal framework my license operate at?
EUPL is clear about that:

&gt;  - this licence shall be governed by Belgian law if the Licensor has no seat,
&gt;   residence or registered office inside a European Union Member State.
What that means it assure about Applicable Law no matter where you are or what you do. If you wish to change that you can clearly define under which Law you want to operate (e.g. US) but notice that this would be your choice and could have different consequences.

You would notice that if license does not specify applicable law there would be always problem no matter if it is Apache, MIT or GPL. For the first time, a public body of the size of European Commission has officially developed and approved open source license which clearly address applicable law for everyone by default.


To summarize it, we picked EUPL because:
• it protects the code by enforcing sharing
• it promote adoption by allowing it to linking with any other license
• it provides unify approach to any work not only code but documentation, materials, use cases, pictures ... any digital and non digital content
• in our opinion provides sustainable development due to above characteristics.
We are not forcing anyone to change their minds in context of Apache2.0, we are happy that everyone would make their own choice. What we are explaining all the time is that there is no reason for any developer within that community to not contribute to EUPL based project. It would serve whole community and everyone around it no matter if he is freelancer or representing company which want to build products on top of it.</div>

                    <div class="msg">Our industry has never found a proper way of dealing with IPRs. The status quo is to go and use the most permissive licensing model, either because it is the most straightforward approach from the adoption perspective or simply because other libraries are using such licenses, so it propagates without any further ado. On the other hand, people are getting pissed. For example, there were several known incidents in the Node ecosystem where library authors removed/broke existing libraries, which broke the whole ecosystem because they were bare bones meaning they were heavily used as a dependency. At the same time, the IT industry developed a unique ecosystem to work with because people are keen to share their work/IPRs to make life easier for others. This ecosystem to sustain needs improvements.

The permissive licensing model, while perfect for companies from the adoption perspective, completely ignores the authors and contributors. Thus, the current licensing model is broken because the most significant value is precisely in the authors and contributors. Their interest in the permissive licensing model is completely ignored.

I fully agree that it is up to someone other than the developer to study licenses, which is this industry's main issue. The current workaround is "use a permissive licensing model," but it is no solution.

By proposing this paradigm shift, we propose to change the so-far used licensing mental model to end up in a better place. Whether it is achievable or not, we will see, but doing nothing will not change anything. While EUPL could be better, it brings some significant changes that precisely change the mental licensing model, and we propose to try it.

Here, in this particular ecosystem, most of the work is paid work. AFAIK few people spend their private time adding contributions. Thus, while changing licensing model might not be in the interest of the companies behind it, it is definitely in the interest of the community as a whole to take care of the community.</div>

                    <div class="msg">I guess if nothing else, though the original question of crate name has hit a dead end it has enticed folks from THCLabs to participate in the community again... its been a long time.   Heck, <@U04F9ME0V39> finally joined the Slack even though it's been around for more than a year.

I have absolutely no interest in discussing or debating licenses.  I've already made my opinion more than clear.  I want Apache2 versions of software to use, full stop.

Since we now have multiple members of THCLabs coming out of the wood work to debate licenses and not address the original question, I am willing to concede the crate name cesrox even though we came up with it at IIW back in April.  Shame on us for not being the ones to squat on the crate name (and CESR too for that matter) when we created the GitHub repo.

If folks would like to continue license debates, we can create a Slack channel for that purpose so we can allow this one to get back to technical discussions of implementing Sam's CESR protocol in Rust.</div>

                    <div class="msg">The argument for me is won by the simple assertion, and the core beauty of KERI and ACDC, that a set of technology protocols for a trust spanning layer must have the lowest bar to entry.  This gets at what the wide-ranging ramifications are you mention <@U04F9ME0V39>, and what Sam makes clear in the KERI whitepaper: this is a huge problem being solved. The solution, like HTTP and TCP/IP, are protocols, not application suites.
As protocols are defined first in specifications it seems to me there is little to gain for a given company, and little to worry about, taking an implementation of a protocol and using it without contributing back to the community. That, in my mind, would be like worrying about Amazon or Google using HTTP and not giving back to the community.</div>

                    <div class="msg">If there were a suite of apps or implementations that KERI and ACDC depended on their implementations to succeed, like the node software for Indy, then I would lean more in favor of EUPL.

The beauty of KERI is that it doesn’t prescribe an architecture like Indy and other ledger software does. KERI is truly ledgerless. It’s just a set of protocols and we happen to be releasing the first few implementations like how LMDB came out of the OpenLDAP project and now has many implementations.</div>

                    <div class="msg">I agree with <@U024CJMG22J> that we should move forward and leave the licensing discussion. The question is settled in my mind.
As much as I love the four freedoms and the whole free software movement of which spirit moves and inspires me I believe licensing is a matter of use case. There are some things that GPL2/3 or EUPL1.2 make sense for. There are things that MPL, MIT, or Apache 2 make sense for.

Given all of the arguments expressed here it seems that KERI and ACDC and attendant libraries make the most sense to release under Apache 2 given that they are protocols first, software second and that we are going for the lowest bar of entry.</div>

                    <div class="msg"><!channel> as addressed above we would like to make a decision about cesrox namespace allocated under <http://crates.io|crates.io>. Namespace was allocated by HCF team for implementation of CESROX which was in development since quite some time. Since that implementation is under EUPL1.2 license  and was allocated without consultation with community we would like to find out how to move forward. In my opinion the most fair solution would be to hear everyone voice and based on that decided on potential transition.
Please try to answer following questions and if needed provide additional comments or information relevant for that:
1. Would you like to move cesrox namespace on <http://crates.io|crates.io> allocated for EUPL1.2 implementation of cesorx to Apache2.0 implemenation?
2. If transition would be done, are you aware that under that project the package would include 2 conflicting licenses in the history of crate and  you don't think that this would be problem from adoption perspective and won't confuse people trying to use it in the future?
3. If you are in favor of other solution to address that conflict please state it.
Please comment in thread what is your opinion on that conflict, providing argumentation if any, your affiliation if you represent bigger group, your interested, stake and type of the contribution which you did and/or planning to do to help others justify your voice (all voices are equal but it would be unfair in my opinion to do voting anonymously).

All information would then collected and final decision would be taken during one of the cesrox regular meeting (if there would be enough time for voting we would like to do on following meeting if not we would do it in two weeks.</div>

                    <div class="msg">I am Head of Technology Council at Human Colossus Foundation, and CTO at MeDDEa Solutions. HCF is early adopter and implementer of keri ecosystem components. From day one HCF togheter with  Jolocom and Argonauths build first rust implementation of keri components (including cesrox). After realizing risks related with the licensing we decided to change license from Apache to EUPL to protect community, donating in the same time implementation which we did on Apache2.0 to WebOfTrust repo as previously it was developed under DIF. Observing activities within our community I realized that few people would like to reactivate rust implementation of KERI under Apache2.0, I was happy to see that finally people notice values of multi-target source code which definitely would   help with adoption. We were working on those project since 2020 and had already plans to extract components of `cesrox`, `said` and `teilox` as separate crates, I took immediate decision to secure the namespace. If it was fair or not you would judge. Both as HCF and MeDDEa we invested quite number of resources and money in development of those libraries even that is very early we already have some customers who are starting using them. We continue investing and committing for sustainable development and support  of this community and rust implementation of keri components in the future.
Because of the mistake I created both namespaces on <http://crates.io|crates.io> `cesr` and `cesrox` - `cesr` is not used since following the naming convention the intention was to name create as the git repository for marketing purposes. Unfortunately there is no way to remove namespace on <http://crate.io|crate.io>. We do not control or own `keri` namespace as it was stated in the first comment by <@U024KC347B4>, this belongs to DIF (or at least members of the DIF group) we do not intent to use or have neither `keri` nor `keriox` namespace at <http://crates.io|crates.io> since those would not be libraries and does not make sense to distribute them through <http://crates.io|crates.io>.

Answering the question:
1. I would vote against moving `cesrox` namespace due to practical reasons. There is some hassle for community which is already using `cesrox` and would generate confusion on <http://crates.io|crates.io> directly due to change of license.
2. I am aware of that issue and I see that this could not look very good and could generate questions about licensing of the whole crate if it consist of some EUPL code.
3. Since `cesr` namespace was allocated as well with EUPL would generate same problem but would not make any addition effort for those who already using `cesrox` I would suggest to pick any available namespace and create it from scratch to avoid problems in the future.
I would like to add that neither personally nor as representative of HCF and MeDDEa I am not against Apache2.0 implementation and I am happy to see others contributions and their choices. Releasing the namespace on crates is as well not a problem although I think it won't be fair on front of all those developers who worked almost 2 years on those projects just to take it without solid reason. If the community would vote in favor of that transition I would be happy to assist and help to do the transfer. It is just a name and we still relatively early with adoption that won't cause negative impact. I just hope that after that transition, commitment of those who vote in favor would make sure to keep this package in healthy state as we would do it.</div>

                    <div class="msg">The next regular CESRox meeting is this Thursday the 22nd. Due to the Christmas holiday it may make more sense to meet on Jan 5th, the next regular meeting. This would give us time to assemble arguments and notify interested parties to be there. On the other hand it would be advantageous to make this decision as soon as possible.
If we have any major parties missing on the 22nd then I suggest we reschedule.</div>

                    <div class="msg">I am Daniel Hardman, CTO of Provenant.

I think that as a matter of fairness and courtesy, the names "keri" and "cesr" should be treated as property of the inventor. (Note that the preceding sentence is not a statement about copyright law or legal theory, but about simple human kindness.) Going slightly further, Sam is writing IETF specs and using those names for them, and I think it is preferable that reference implementations of those technologies carry approximately the same name.

This does not exactly answer the 3 questions, though. I'm just stating some principles.

I think the "ox" in keriox and cesrox is cute, but is not fundamental to the question, so the fact that those names have been allocated is perhaps suboptimal but not a serious problem. Therefore:

1. I guess I vote against trying to move the namespace, on the theory that it's a lot of bother and it's easier to just invent a new name.
2. Having 2 conflicting licenses is not a problem at all. Happens with maybe half of all repos that ever existed, because if they didn't have a LICENSE file in the initial commit, and get one later, then they are in the 2 license state. The only thing that matters is what LICENSE applies going forward.</div>

                    <div class="msg">3. I am not in favor of any other solution, but I think we should acknowledge that it's desirable to do two things going forward: 1) clearly announce forks in the road with respect to licensing; and 2) try to communicate and honor the intentions of an inventor with respect to the names (not licenses, just names) of technology they invent.

We live in an imperfect world, and I think people's intentions have been to do the best possible things they could, so that is not a criticism of anyone -- just a note about lessons learned.</div>

                    <div class="msg">In case I am late this morning (Thursdays/Fridays I drop my son off at daycare, unfortunate timing) I figured I would just put my thoughts here:

1. For me there is no naming strategy/releases and/or transfers to discuss.
My original ask was answered with “No“ (I paraphrased) due to the history mechanism present in <http://crates.io|crates.io>. If people want to debate renaming what resides under web of trust, that’s for the community to decide, I have no opinion.

 2. For me there is no license strategy clarification moving forward.
There are two implementations under two different licenses, the community is free to contribute where they like, such is open source. If you want to vote to change the license under WoT to EUPL-2.0, just contribute to the THCLab one, and vice versa.
If the community wants to vote to remove one or the other, I would say that is excessive and let bygones be bygones.

3. See #2.
While I appreciate Daniels suggestion I feel that having all THCLab efforts be derived from an Apache-2.0 and then subsequently relicensed by THCLab under EUPL-2.0 downstream would not meet their requirements, hence why they moved to EUPL-2.0 in the first place.</div>

1. The group has been renamed for broad applicability from the CESROX Working Group to the CESR Working Group as is reflected in the channel name changing from `#cesrox` to `#cesr`.
2. The naming and licensing fork was acknowledged between WoT and THCLabs. As a result this working group is coming up with a set of names, headed up by Kevin Griffin, to be voted on next meeting, Thursday January 19th. Suggested names so far include:
    a. CESRust / cesrust- Steven Milstein
    b. CESRide / cesride - Kevin Griffin
    c. cesr-lib - Joseph Hunsaker
    d. cesr_lib - Joseph Hunsaker
3. Focusing of this group on the core API of Rust CESR and the foreign function interface (FFI) layer required for cross-language usability.
Next meeting we will vote on a name for the WebOfTrust repository and continue our discussion on the core API and FFI layer.</div>

                    <div class="msg">This is interesting to me, but are you concerned about the double and similar meaning of 'digest' (to process vs the explicit product of a hashing process) in this context?

`cesr-rs` is another suitable repo name based on what I've seen in the rust community, but I believe the package/crate names of such repos may sometimes drop the `rs` which could pose a problem here.</div>

                    <div class="msg">Over the weekend I implemented `Matter` in `cesride` at parity with `KERIpy` (I believe). Here's the code:
<https://github.com/jasoncolburne/cesride/tree/spike>

It can probably use some more work, I'm a fairly new Rust coder (2 months but pretty intensive) but it's a good start. <@U024KC347B4> you probably want to check this out as I noticed you made some changes, too. I can open a PR for review if people want? I'm willing to contribute a great deal to this suite of projects in Rust.

I tested this by instantiating `Matter` several different ways, in one gross function. It grew out of what was there, I just kind of took the path of least resistance but this is where my work could benefit the most, I believe. Better tests. I will add them later. I did generate lots of tests for `Sizages` and `Codes` though. Normally I wouldn't throw down a 1300 line PR but this is a foundational bit that was hard to get away from.

For the curious, I used string transformations in Ruby to turn Python codexes etc into Rust code directly.</div>

                    <div class="msg">Hey guys. I'm looking into the cesride code and trying to understand the parside one's functionality.
As I see currently cesride's Matter::new_with_code_and_raw() does analyzis, reading and parsing primitives by itself.
So the logic of the parser is to read the top level group and call the proper codex table implementation. Very primitive pseudocode is like:
```    pub fn from_bytes(bytes: &amp;[u8]) -&gt; CesrResult&lt;CesrGroup&gt; {
        let (rest, payload_type) = take_bytes(bytes, 2u8)?;
        let (rest, group_len) = take_bytes(bytes, 2u8)?;
        let (group_item_records, item_table) = cesride::get_group_codex(payload_type);
        for i in 0..group_len {
            for i in 0..group_item_records {
                let (rest, bytes) = parse_primitive(rest);
                current_item.append(CesrPrimitive(code, bytes));
            }
            group.append(current_item);
        }
        return group;
    }```
My understanding from all the discussions was more like:
• parside calls cesride for fixed size types to get the size.
• parside calls cesride to get the counter group description (how many primitives are a single group item).
• parside reads all codes and data by itself.
• additionally cesride either
    ◦ provides information about what special parser to use for such types like datetime or url-like strings or
    ◦ provides the parser callback for such types
• cesride does not contain any verifier, signer, digester and so on crypto stuff. It's all the keri logic and not related to CESR at leas as I can read it in the draft.
Can someone please help me to better understand it?</div>

Yes, it's okay if we combine cesr data tables definition for `parside` with keri crypto primitives logic in `cesride` since `cesride` is designed for keri and crypto primitives.
Other points still not clear for me.</div>

                    <div class="msg">Parside is responsible for initial stream introspection, I'm guessing  a vec&lt;u8&gt; entrypoint (whatever we can work with the FFI, can you use a future::stream in the FFI?)

It peaks/sniffs the first tritet of that vec/&amp;[u8] determines, is this a binary or text stream, at that point it passes it off to a Binary/Text Parser, those parsers will peak the stream (I'm going to keep saying stream but I mean whatever vec/u8 we can work with the FFI) that peak will determine if it's json/cbor/msgpk encoded, then use the vesionage to determine the event size, likely discard that... because why would cesr know about your domain objects, then hand off decoding to the requisite parser which will create CESRide primitive objects out of the remaining stream bits.</div>

                    <div class="msg">Some thoughts from Sam on parside

&gt; Parside should start with a default version for CESR. Anytime it gets a version count code it changes the version and also elevates to the top level (the version count code must appear at the top level). The version count code determines which CESR table to load when parsing the stream. The sniffer detects if CESR binary, CESR Text, JSON, CBOR, MGPK. If any of the last three then the parser regexes to find the version string inside the JSON, CBOR, and MGPK and from the version string extracts the number of characters/bytes that is the length of the JSON, CBOR, or MGPK. The parser then resumes sniffing. When the sniff is CESR then when at the top level looks for the CESR version count code or any other count codes. The interpretation of the count codes is dependent on the version count code that is why the Parser has to start with a default version count code because the stream may not begin with a version code or may have resumed after a cold restart. When a count code is parsed then the parser may descend into parsing whats inside group for a group count code which may recursively nest down a ways.</div>

                    <div class="msg">Kevin, thank you for clarifying it.
Here are my follow-up questions:

&gt; the parser regexes to find the version string inside the JSON, CBOR, and MGPK and from the version string extracts the number of characters/bytes that is the length of the JSON, CBOR, or MGPK
• So any stream appearing to CESR parser must contain the version string not the only inside CESR data but in JSON, CBOR or MGPK as well? Ever if we talk not about KERI, but just about a custom data tables implementation?
• I'm not close to CBOR and MGPK spec, but it's binary so wouldn't regex have collisions?
&gt; When the sniff is CESR then when at the top level looks for the CESR version count code or any other count codes
• Am I correct that the top level here is an exact `--GGGVVV` as a root object in the stream? Not a kind of a first item in a top-level box like `-VXX--GGGVVV-A&lt;following data&gt;`? Just looking to Keri streams I see data flow like `{json msg}-VXX&lt;cesr box&gt;{json msg}-VXX&lt;cesr box&gt;` So version switch here will look like `{json msg}-VXX&lt;cesr box&gt;{json msg}-VXX&lt;cesr box&gt;--AABAAB-VXX&lt;alternate cesr data box&gt;` . Correct?
And just common one is how parser appear to an application? Provides callbacks or returns an iterator or a vector of parsed data?</div>

I'm not sure I agree with "as well" currently json is the only serialization we use and it does have a versionage, I imagine the CESR event format will as well, but that's still only one versionage per event</div>

To simplify external use of it and the delivery process I'd like to have FFI a single project providing both parser interface and the default primitives implementation at once. So I see it a separate GitHub project that would depend on parside and cesride.</div>

                    <div class="msg">Hey folks. A couple of branches just pushed for review of our view of the parside design. Review and feedback is highly appreciated. <@U024KC347B4> <@U04HQD29Z7E> :pray:

<https://github.com/DSRCorporation/parside/tree/iitial-implementation-with-generic-result>
This one returns custom generic type without particular groups definition. In this case we need to create a third crate combining parside and cerside defining groups constructors.

<https://github.com/DSRCorporation/parside/tree/initial-implementation>
This one contains definitions of groups that makes using of the libraries easier for third party applications. We just need to add constructors there. With this approach we don't need for a third crate.

And there still one more question:
Why we do not want to define exact cesr groups inside the cesride library? Since we already define a lot of things related to keri just there.</div>

                    <div class="msg">Thanks, it seems I cannot assign issues to people who are not part of the WoT org, and since this is Sams "free" org I am wondering if we can just implement some house keeping rules:

• Comment on an issue if you are deciding to work on it
• Open a PR and set it to draft, then reference the issue in the comment, even if there is nothing in it, it is another indication that someone is working on it
• Lastly, mention it in slack.
If these make sense I'll update the readme too, this applies to folks within the WoT too.</div>

                    <div class="msg">As most know there has been a slow progress on getting the first parside PR merged due to conversations around the impact on cesride.

We had a working call this morning with the developers involved to try come to a path forward ahead of the regular community meeting.

The path forward is as follows:

• ~Review and (hopefully) merge outstanding PR #103 (<@U024KC347B4>, <@U04EFUFR71Q>, <@U04HQD29Z7E>)~ :white_check_mark:
• Create a new PR for a version bump for cesride and publish to <http://crates.io|crates.io> (<@U024KC347B4>)
• Create a new PR which introduces a thin UDL layer (for uniffi) for cesride to expose the primitives needed for parside (<@U04EFUFR71Q>)
• Update the parside PR #2 to use this (<@U04EFUFR71Q>)
• Merge ...
• Celebrate :tada:
I'd like to thank <@U04EFUFR71Q> <@U048YRLFKTK> and <@U04HQD29Z7E> for their work on coming to a resolution.

As a side note, we should discuss an approach to releases on Thursday.</div>

                    <div class="msg">I found use of this code in `Salter`:
&gt; `crypto_pwhash_ALG_DEFAULT`: the currently recommended algorithm, which can change from one version of libsodium to another.
Though I don't see Argon2 being replaced for a while, I'd recommend fixing your algorithm so the results don't break. Probably (need to confirm but usually the default), you want:
&gt; `crypto_pwhash_ALG_ARGON2ID13`: version 1.3 of the Argon2id algorithm, available since libsodium 1.0.13.
You may also want to make the params fixed (and apparently only 2 of 3 are available through `pysodium`).

                    <div class="msg">I got around to building a simple `messagize()` and signed a more complex inception statement, but I wasn't sure what to use for the path when generating `Signers` from a `Salter`. I generated current, next and witness keys. I know I didn't need the witness ones (or technically even the next keys yet) but I want to make a receipt. Anyhow, here's the output, but unsure if it will verify given the paths:

```from <http://keri.app|keri.app> import habbing
from keri.app.cli.common import displaying

with habbing.openHab(name="test", temp=True) as (hby, hab):
    print(hab.pre)
    
    icp = (&lt;inception event here&gt;)

    hby.psr.parse(bytearray(icp))

    displaying.printExternal(hby, "&lt;aid here&gt;")```
Just copy and paste your inception event as binary (b'...') and add the AID from your 'i' field and see if you get output.</div>

                    <div class="msg">Hey folks, we've been having some discussion and it seems  given the direction and momentum of signing at the edge (signifypy, signify-TS, and signifide) and the drop off in the need for an edu call, alongside the completion of CESR (way to go Jason) that we could re-purpose both calls for a weekly signify dev call.

We've seen increased interest from multiple parties and it seems wise to utilize this (Thursdays 10am EST) slot moving forward.

The call will be focused on those implementing "signing at the edge", integration with KERIA etc, and not focused on spec Q&amp;A (we have Tuesday calls for that). We'll likely try rotate the focus between implementations if we find the need to do so.

I'd like one more cesride call to discuss cesride/parside/keride and we need a week or so to gather peoples opinions.

Please respond in the <#C04G1KR5R6D|signify> channel, that's where we'll try gather consensus.</div>
