				<div class="card-text msg">Thanks for setting up this channel, <@U024CJMG22J>. I'm a Brit based in
						Basel, Switzerland. It is a pleasure to e-meet you.

						As I mentioned in the <#C03TSFRNWLU|cesrox> channel, I'm the inventor of *OCA*, a core utility
							technology that underpins Layer 1 of the <https:
								//static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf|HCF
								stack>. As such, the <https:
									//eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32017D0863&amp;from=EN|EUPL
									v1.2> vs <https: //www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0|Apache 2.0> licencing debate
										is of particular interest as it sits at the core of the refactored next-gen data
										economy.

										With the unprecedented projected increase of _"data"_ across the digital
										landscape over the next several years, Europe is committed to implementing
										scalable and distributed data ecosystems to ensure European digital sovereignty
										through the <http:
											//dataspaces.info/common-european-data-spaces/#page-content|Common European
											Data Spaces> initiative, part of the <https:
												//digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/strategy-data|European
												Strategy for data>. The major EU-funded projects (e.g., <https:
													//ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSI/Home|EBSI>
													, the <https:
														//digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation|eIDAS
														Regulation>, etc.) use <https:
															//eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32017D0863&amp;from=EN|EUPL
															v1.2> as a multilingual open-source licence to support that
															mission. I thought it would be helpful to add this framing
															to help people understand the digital landscape in Europe.
															The EU has developed the EUPL licence to ensure that the
															European digital infrastructure doesn't fragment. Will the
															U.S. follow suit? This discussion may act as a catalyst.

															At HCF, we are adopting the fundamentals of two core utility
															technologies, <https: //oca.colossi.network|OCA> (Semantic
																domain) and <https: //keri.one|KERI> (Inputs domain). We
																	have chosen the EUPL licence at the Foundation to
																	ensure that the core codebases don't fragment. An
																	open-source IPR licence for the underpinnings of an
																	entirely new web infrastructure needs to be robust.
																	By _"robust"_, I mean those fundamentals can't
																	fragment at the lowest technical layers of the DDE.
																	<https: //www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0|Apache
																		2.0> is a licence widely adopted for a "broken"
																		Internet. However, thanks to <@U013F46SDRR>'s
																			wisdom at HCF, we are aware of the licencing
																			problem and have drafted a _<https:
																				//docs.google.com/document/d/100NZaAWYZ6PZWg_xhKs8GhLPgyAaDYeapEO_nP5_scQ/edit#|"Code
																				of Ethical Licencing">_ to clarify our
																				position.

																				As OCA and KERI demonstrate, the
																				innovation across the Semantic and
																				Inputs domains is profound. In line with
																				these new technologies, we may need a
																				new licence to protect them. Innovation
																				in the Governance domain, in this case,
																				is also required. The arguments that
																				Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux
																				kernel, puts forward in the video, _
																				<https:
																					//www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaKIZ7gJlRU|"GPL
																					v3 violates everything that GPLv2
																					stood for">_, are precisely why the
																					issue of licencing is such a key
																					topic at HCF.

																					The ramifications go far beyond this
																					community. Other core utility
																					technologies in the first layer of
																					the <https:
																						//static1.squarespace.com/static/5ead4c8660689c348c80958e/t/62f2893465394d4b829661bc/1660062007339/HCF+DDE+Trust+Infrastructure+Stack+v1.0.0.pdf|HCF>
																						and <https:
																							//trustoverip.org/toip-model/|ToIP>
																							stacks will need to be
																							resolute and compatible to
																							stop potential
																							fragmentation. I'm keen to
																							learn from the leading
																							voices of this community
																							before the discussion comes
																							to a natural conclusion.
																							Let's hope we all end up on
																							the same page.

																							By the way, outside of HCF,
																							this is the first time I've
																							seen this debate in any
																							other open community forums,
																							so this is a neat place to
																							continue the discussion. We
																							might even persuade some
																							lawyers to join the debate
																							for some of the trickier
																							questions. But, at the very
																							least, we all must clearly
																							understand the consequential
																							outcomes of these critical
																							decisions.

																							So, let's keep our toys in
																							the pram and have a healthy
																							and well-considered debate.
																							I'm here to learn.</div>

				<div class="card-text msg">Practically speaking everyone who knows how keri components works, knows that
					not many developers/companies would be interested in contributing in that code base as the entry
					level is quite high. It would be lead by few organizations or freelancers which are interested in
					technology itself, and the rest would consume it as it is. Obviously this know-how can be easily

					won't force sharing some of the organization/individuals could get into trap of conflict of interest
					where sharing could be treated as direct danger for potential revenue.

					I can easily imagine companies like IBM to "take over" development and use their resources to offer

				<div class="card-text msg">I find the concern about tech giants taking over development to be
					unconvincing. That's not because it can't happen, but because A) right now adoption and sponsorship
					by a tech giant would be a blessing, not a curse; and B) we don't have any reason to believe that if
					they adopted the technology, they would take it in a bad direction (has Google ruined REST? has
					Microsoft ruined XML? has Apple ruined JSON?). In my experience, it is during *design* that tech
					giant influence can dangerously skew things, not when implementing against a crisp spec. Are we
					still designing KERI and CESR?

					I also disagree with Robert's reasoning on barrier to entry. The fact that a number of community
					members are uneasy about EUPL is direct, concrete, timely proof that EUPL is a barrier to entry; the
					copyleft in the license scares people away. I KNOW this is true from first-hand experience, and I am
					confident that my experience isn't a weird anomaly. I believe Robert when he says that he hasn't
					encountered these barriers with his customers, but I suggest this is true because we are imagining
					two different kinds of usage. If companies just want to *use* tech that someone else writes, then
					copyleft is no big deal. All of us use GPL'ed stuff in linux all the time, without giving it a
					second thought. But if companies want to *contribute to* tech that is copylefted, it's a whole
					different analysis.

					The assertion that EUPL's copyleft is no problem whatsoever rings false to me. I'm sure tons of EU
					lawyers have reviewed the license, and as I said, I think it probably IS the case that "derivative
					work" will end up being acknowledged to exclude source code linked to a library across an interface
					boundary -- in the EU.

					Robert cited a line from the license that says that if no other legal jurisdiction is identified,
					Belgium law applies. The "if" in the line is the problem, and it actually makes my point. Most
					companies that offer contracts to their customers identify a legal jurisdiction, and only ones that
					pick an EU jurisdiction will have the legal perspective that EU lawyers like. It's extremely common
					(almost universal) to pick the jurisdiction where a company is incorporated, because legal fees are
					less if the court is local. Thus, the statement that EU law applies if no other law is specified
					helps almost nobody outside the EU.

					A "derivative work" is NOT guaranteed to be evaluated according to an EU law perspective if a
					lawsuit is adjudicated in the UK or Mexico or Canada or Japan or the US. That's why I asked if there
					was case law or precedent that could be cited. I can't find any. That's a problem.

					Speaking just for Provenant, I think we might be able to use EUPL-licensed code and run the risk
					that the copyleft provision in the license would never be enforced against higher levels of our
					software stack. But what would make me totally comfortable is if the license had an explicit
					statement like the following:

					&gt; In this license, "derivative work" means a work of software that changes the source code of the
					library, and explicitly excludes works of software that call the library against published library
					interfaces. Thus, it is possible to consume the library either as a pre-compiled artifact or as
					unmodified source code without creating a derivative work.
					As I understand it, that is what Robert is claiming the license already means, and what his

					<pre>If companies just want to use tech that someone else writes, then copyleft is no big deal. All of us use GPL'ed stuff in linux all the time, without giving it a second thought. But if companies want to contribute to tech that is copylefted, it's a whole different analysis.<pre>
Very good point, I had a chance to work with companies which are on both side means they are interested in contributing to the source code, as well as companies which just consume it (most of them obviously are on the consuming side).

Consuming part is not an issue as you mentioned. The problem is with contribution to the code. Practically speaking this is not easy thing to do, you can't just get random dev throw him into that space and hope that he would do right things. Just starting with 150 pages of whitepaper is high enough barrier for most. I think we can agree that having specific skill set is required and a lot of time to chew what Sam produced.

My point is that I don't see any big tech throwing resources here until they would see direct benefits. It is rather smaller companies or units which are interested into "let's see if we can create better future". They tried that with blockchain they would try it with KERI. Basically early adopters or believers where they can see benefits of having infrastructure like that.

In first stage where we are the biggest concern are startups and VC founded entities who under pressure of delivery won't have time to build it right and would do a lot of short cuts, in consequence which we could end up in the situation where they (intentionally - to gain competitive advantage, or unintentionally - just lack of time) would postpone to contribute back. This would lead to forks and lack of interoperability. When the technology would be at certain stage it would be necessary to bring it to the enterprise level where "big tech" companies comes in. We saw how IBM treated Indy or Fabric in that regards. Having this extra security would help community and smaller players to compete with them and benefit from their involvement when that would happen.</div>

I would say that we still are at the design level, Sam is doing amazing work to flesh all that all but we still observing some core changes in both keri and cesr. It is clear that without Sam this won't be possible and I would love to provide him all necessary resources to let him continue solving those problems and get stable spec, I think we are close enough but still lots of work is needed. The reason for it that we need to test it in practice to see how it would work, we are on PoC level where we would find out what else is missing. At least that is my judgment.</div>

This is interesting point as well which actually not sure how applies to other licenses. I didn't saw many licences which specify what is applicable law of that license. Since we are decentralized community would it be always the person from first commit? Author jurisdiction?

I like that with EUPL that is explicit. you know exactly what to expect.
I agree with the point that EUPL didn't do it well by not specifying "derivation work" clearly without references to any other law framework. As this would make it super explicit and clear. We are planning to contribute that to the next version of EUPL to make sure that this would be cover, until then we need to bound it under EU law or explicitly specify that as you requested.

Since behind cesorx and keriox we have HCF as a author, we are under Belgium law (we are based in CH). Even that we have multiple contributors. We specifically wanted to have one entity behind it since it makes it easier for compliance and regulation. As you may know even if you have license and you would not specify copyrights this would fail any check in legal department). Not knowing who is behind it (as one entity) is the worst thing which you can have in enterprise. This was one of the reason why DIF changed their policy about individual contributes and similar activities we observe in ecosystem.</div>

The Apache 2 license doesn't contain a clause like the one you identified in EUPL, stating what legal jurisdiction governs. Therefore, I think this creates a potential ambiguity. However, that license does not reserve to the content creator the right to enforce a copyleft provision, so the ambiguity is not dangerous in practice -- there is less to enforce. Specifically, it says the following: `For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.`What this boils down to is that, unless you are copying the material in a way that fails to give credit to original authors or that attempts to subvert the grant-of-patent-license that Apache 2 intends, it's pretty hard to violate the license, no matter what legal jurisdiction you're in.</div>

            	<div class="card-text msg">I am not a lawyer, but I'm pretty confident that the answer to your export question is no. Here's my reasoning; see if you agree.

US export law recognizes a distinction between exporting products and publishing source code. According to the wikipedia article you linked, exporting products (ready-made tools to do fancy stuff) that contain certain kinds of crypto requires approval, whereas publishing open source (telling the world how to make tools) merely requires notification (but not approval/permission). Publishing a compiled app on the app store = exporting a product; sharing code on github = releasing source code.

Setting that line of thought aside, here's the second reason I don't think so.

The existing impls of KERI do not themselves implement any cryptography. Rather, they call libraries like libsodium that implement cryptography. Libsodium must have complied with the requirement to notify BIS before it was released to open source. (Or maybe, the forerunner of libsodium, NaCl, would have complied. NaCl was sponsored by both the European Commission and the National Science Foundation and is well known to the US government; I don't think we have to feel responsible to tell them that libraries can be built atop it. But when finished products get shipped atop it, then the export concern may be triggered.)

But as I said, I'm not a lawyer.</div>

Thank you to all who attended today’s meeting. A few important events happened today.
1. The group has been renamed for broad applicability from the CESROX Working Group to the CESR Working Group as is reflected in the channel name changing from `#cesrox` to `#cesr`.
2. The naming and licensing fork was acknowledged between WoT and THCLabs. As a result this working group is coming up with a set of names, headed up by Kevin Griffin, to be voted on next meeting, Thursday January 19th. Suggested names so far include:
    a. CESRust / cesrust- Steven Milstein
    b. CESRide / cesride - Kevin Griffin
    c. cesr-lib - Joseph Hunsaker
    d. cesr_lib - Joseph Hunsaker
3. Focusing of this group on the core API of Rust CESR and the foreign function interface (FFI) layer required for cross-language usability.
Next meeting we will vote on a name for the WebOfTrust repository and continue our discussion on the core API and FFI layer.</div>

            	<div class="card-text msg">Thanks for sharing that observation, interesting to see that there is more companies/communities rising that issue. Honestly technically speaking there is no reason to be worry about that situation, there is a lot of open source projects which are running without governance (they are just private repositories all over the place) and they are fine, communities are build around it and development move on. Unfortunately not everyone think that way and some organization (gov/enterprise) they are very uncomfortable to deal with projects which does not have "proper" governance around it. Having legal structure around it helps a lot in such situation.

To get that clear by governance I mean that IPR are not in hands of one person but organization / legal entity.
But again technically speaking it does not matter we saw what happened with OpenAI which started as non-for profit and converted after GPT-2 into commercial focus.
The beauty of such projects is that if people realize that something is going off, they fork and move on and if there is a big non-profit organization or individual person does not make huge difference, except....

if the individual person didn't took care properly about protecting work and contribution from day one. WebOfTrust (where most of the repositories of KERI related stuff  is) did it very well, Sam took care of that part carefully to protect IPR from day one.</div>

            	<div class="card-text msg">I would summarize it, that from legal stand point there is nothing to worry, from what I observing the only downside is on the marketing side, when we (HCF) speak with interested parties some of them expecting to have governance in place in a form of legal entity. In our case we are handling that from perspective of Foundation which is based in Switzerland and offering legal protection in regards of all components which are building (including warranty if needed). We are doing that for all DDE components were KERI is one of them. We have long term sustainable roadmap which gives some extra confidence for those who seek it.</div>

• KERI related SPEC - IETF (covered)
• KERI implementation - I am aware of only two: from WebOfTrust (Apache2.0) and Human Colossus (HCF) - EUPL1.2
• KERI ecosystem (all additional libraries, tooling, network components etcc..) - WebOfTrust (Apache 2.0) and HCF ( EUPL1.2 )
In both cases the IPR are in place and there is nothing to worry about as soon as the communities will stay healthy.</div>

Thank you for the insightful response. I agree that the problem is in the marketing side. My impression is that some people are skeptical of adopting KERI. I think more work is still needed to build confidence and get the adoption beyond GLEIF. The care and effort that Sam and WebOfTrust have done may not yet be apparent for people outside our community.</div>
