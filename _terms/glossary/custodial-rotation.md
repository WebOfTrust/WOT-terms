## Definition
Rotation based on control authority that is split between two key sets. The first for signing authority and the second (pre-roateted) for rotation authority the associated thresholds and key list can be structured in such a way that a designated custodial agent can hold signing authority while the original controller can hold exclusive rotation authority.

[Partial pre-rotation](partial-rotation) supports the important use case that of custodial key rotation to authorize a [custodial agent](custodial-agent).\
