## Definition

Matches the act of [delegation](term_delegation) with the appropriate digital twin. Consequently when applied recursively, delegation may be used to compose arbitrarily complex trees of hierarchical (delegative) key management event streams. This is a most powerful capability that may provide an essential building block for a generic universal decentralized key management infrastructure (DKMI) that is also compatible with the demand of generic event streaming applications.

## More KERI context

The KERI design approach is to build composable primitives instead of custom functionality that is so typical of other DKMI approaches:

- [transferable identifiers](term_transferable-identifier)
- [non-transferable identifiers](term_non-transferable-identifier)
- delegated identifiers
