## KERI and ACDC related
The team has put stress on the principle 'security first, confidentiality second and privacy third'. All systems and infrastructure KERI and ACDC has presented therefore constitute a rather small subset of all [self-sovereign identity systems (SSI)](self-sovereign-identity-(SSI)) available nowadays.
