## Definition
provides a uniform mechanism for the issuance and presentation of ACDCs in a securely attributable manner. 

## Relation
A single protocol is able to work for both types of exchanges ([issuance](issuance-exchange) and [presentation](presentation-exchange)) by recognizing that all exchanges (both issuance and presentation) may be modeled as the disclosure of information by a [Discloser](discloser) to a [Disclosee](disclosee).\
The _difference_ between exchange types is _the information disclosed not the mechanism for disclosure_.
