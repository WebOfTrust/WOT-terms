## Definition

This compact encoding scheme fully supports both textual and binary streaming applications of attached crypto material of all types. This approach includes composability in both the textual and binary streaming domains. The primitives may be the minimum possible but still composable size. Making composability a guaranteed property allows future extensible support of new compositions of streaming formats based on pre-existing core primitives and compositions of core primitives. This enables optimized stream processing in both the binary and text domains.
