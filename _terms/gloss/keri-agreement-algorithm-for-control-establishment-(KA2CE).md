Also acronym `KAACE`. A newly invented algorithm but it is a simplification of PBFT class algorithms, separation of control of distributed consensus using distinct promulgation (witness) and confirmation (watcher) networks (new invention) but many non-BFT consensus algorithms do something similar and one BFT algorithm Stellar does something similar but not the same.
What if PBFT and Stellar had a baby that was missing liveness and total ordering but had safety and was completely decentralized, portable, and permission less? It would be named KERI.\
