## KERI related
KERI doesn't need total global ordering, whereas cryptocurrencies do need this. As a consequence has been designed, without the need of a consensus-based distributed ledger (blockchain).

KERI doesn't provide for a currency system, however a KERI-based system can be easily extended with a money - or token system.
